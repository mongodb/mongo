/* config.h.in.  Generated from configure.ac by autoheader.  */


/* On Unix-like systems config.h.in is converted by "configure" into config.h.
Some other environments also support the use of "configure". PCRE is written in
Standard C, but there are a few non-standard things it can cope with, allowing
it to run on SunOS4 and other "close to standard" systems.

If you are going to build PCRE "by hand" on a system without "configure" you
should copy the distributed config.h.generic to config.h, and then set up the
macro definitions the way you need them. You must then add -DHAVE_CONFIG_H to
all of your compile commands, so that config.h is included at the start of
every source.

Alternatively, you can avoid editing by using -D on the compiler command line
to set the macro values. In this case, you do not have to set -DHAVE_CONFIG_H.

PCRE uses memmove() if HAVE_MEMMOVE is set to 1; otherwise it uses bcopy() if
HAVE_BCOPY is set to 1. If your system has neither bcopy() nor memmove(), set
them both to 0; an emulation function will be used. */

/* By default, the \R escape sequence matches any Unicode line ending
   character or sequence of characters. If BSR_ANYCRLF is defined, this is
   changed so that backslash-R matches only CR, LF, or CRLF. The build- time
   default can be overridden by the user of PCRE at runtime. On systems that
   support it, "configure" can be used to override the default. */
