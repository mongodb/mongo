     * Transforms an outgoing message to conditionally mask "state change" errors,

     * that sent it, such as marking it "Unknown". A shutdown error that's emitted
     * by a proxy server (e.g. mongos) can be misinterpreted by a naive client to
     * be indicative of the proxy server shutting down. So this simple rewrite
     * scheme attempts to mask those errors on the way out.
     *
     * Return a disengaged optional if no rewrite is needed.
     * Otherwise, returns a copy of doc with the errors rewritten.
     *
     * Error-bearing subobjects are places in the document where a `code` element
     * can indicate an error status. When rewriting, any error-bearing subobjects
     * are examined for a `code` element.
     *
     * In an error document (with "ok" mapped to 0.0), only the root element is
     * error-bearing. In a success document (where "ok" is mapped to 1.0), the
     * `writeConcernError` subobject and all the subobjects in the `writeErrors`
     * BSON array are error-bearing subobjects.
     *
     * Rewriting occurs only if all of these conditions are met:
     *
     *   - This feature wasn't deselected with a `setEnabled` call, either on the
     *     `opCtx` or for more widely for its associated ServiceContext.
     *     This will happen with failpoint-induced errors or with "hello" commands,
     *     both of which are exempt from state change error rewriting.
     *
     *   - `doc` contains error nodes that need rewriting.
     *       - Codes in the `NotPrimaryError` category always need rewriting.
     *       - Codes in the `ShutdownError` category need rewriting unless this
     *         server is shutting down.
     *
     * Any rewritten `code` is replaced by `HostUnreachable`, and associated
     * `codeName` replaced to be consistent with the new code. Additionally, the
     * `errmsg` in the subobject has all occurrences of the key phrases "not
     * master" and "node is recovering" replaced with "(NOT_PRIMARY)" and
     * "(NODE_IS_RECOVERING)" respectively so that client state changes based on
     * the presence of these legacy strings are suppressed.
