 * * The value is affected by collation, and the query collation does not match the sharding
 * collation
 * * The field is hashed.
 *
 * For specific use cases (see cluster_find_and_modify_cmd targetSingleShard), hashed fields may not
 * prevent single shard targeting; such callers can set permitHashedFields.

 *  queryHasSimpleCollation : true
 *  permitHashedFields      : <any>

 *  shardKey                : {a: 123, b: null}
 *  queryHasSimpleCollation : false
 *  permitHashedFields      : <any>
 *  -> eoo() : no fields are affected by collation.
 *
 *  shardKeyPattern         : {a: 1, b: 1}
 *  shardKey                : {a: 123, b: "foobar"}
 *  queryHasSimpleCollation : false
 *  permitHashedFields      : <any>
 *  -> {b: "foobar"} : strings are affected by collation, and collation differs from sharding
 * collation.
 *
 *  shardKeyPattern         : {a: "hashed", b: 1}
 *  shardKey                : {a: 123, b: "foobar"}
 *  queryHasSimpleCollation : false
 *  permitHashedFields      : false
 *  -> {a: 123} : field a is hashed in shardKeyPattern
 *
 *  shardKeyPattern         : {a: "hashed", b: 1}
 *  shardKey                : {a: 123, b: "foobar"}
 *  queryHasSimpleCollation : false
 *  permitHashedFields      : true
