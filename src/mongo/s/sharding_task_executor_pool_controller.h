/**
 * A special Controller for the sharding ConnectionPool
 *
 * This class has two special members:
 * * A global set of synchronized Parameters for the ShardingTaskExecutorPool server parameters
 * * A ReplicaSetChangeListener to inform it of changes to replica set membership
 *
 * When the MatchingStrategy from its Parameters is kDisabled, this class operates much like the
 * LimitController but with its limits allowed to shift at runtime (via Parameters).
 *
 * When the MatchingStrategy is kMatchPrimaryNode, the limits are obeyed but, when the pool for a
 * primary member calls updateHost, it can increase the targetConnections for the pool of each other
 * member of its replica set. Note that this will, at time of writing, follow the "hosts" field
 * from the primary isMaster combined with the seed list for the replica set. If the seed list were
 * to include arbiters or hidden members, then they would also be subject to these constraints.
 *
 * When the MatchingStrategy is kMatchBusiestNode, it operates like kMatchPrimaryNode, but any pool
 * can be responsible for increasing the targetConnections of each member of its set.
 *
 * Note that, in essence, there are three outside elements that can mutate the state of this class:
 * * The ReplicaSetChangeNotifier can notify the listener which updates the host groups
 * * The ServerParameters can update the Parameters which will used in the next update
 * * The SpecificPools for its ConnectionPool can updateHost with their individual States
