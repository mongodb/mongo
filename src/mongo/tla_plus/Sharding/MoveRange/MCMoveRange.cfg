PROPERTIES
    \* - Disabled by default as temporal properties aren't fully covered when state constraints are
    \*   enabled. Consider enabling it if disabling `ConstraintAllKeysReturned'.
    \*   Note that `ConstraintsAllKeysReturned' overlaps with (and implicitly covers)
    \*   `PropertyAllKeysReturned' in that model checking effectively continues evaluating next
    \*   states until the "all keys returned" property is satisfied.
\*  PropertyAllKeysReturned

CONSTRAINT
    \* - Consider disabling CHECK_DEADLOCK when `ConstraintAllKeysReturned' is disabled, since the
    \*   model is unbounded in the absence of constraints.
