--------------------------------------- MODULE MoveRange -------------------------------------------
\* This specification models the range migration commit protocol along with the routing and data
\* ownership filtering protocols for untimestamped and at a point-in-time reads.
\* - The range migration commit protocol is described at
\*   https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/db/s/README_migrations.md
\* - The CRUD operation, including routing and data ownership filtering, is described at
\*   https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/s/query/README.md
\*
\* This specification:
\* - Models ranges as single-key ranges, for simplicity. The terms 'keys' and 'ranges' are used
\*   interchangeably.
\* - Models targeted queries covering the full key space. Queries are targeted in the sense that
\*   they are routed exclusively to shards that own a range for the collection.
\* - Does not cover writes. From a routing and shard ownership perspective, writes obey the same
\*   rules as the reads modelled in this spec.
\*
\* To run the model-checker, first edit the constants in MCMoveRange.cfg if desired, then:
\*     cd src/mongo/tla_plus
\*     ./model-check.sh MoveRange

(* Global and networking variables *)
VARIABLES request, response \* Emulate RPC with queues between the router and the shards.
VARIABLE migrationState     \* Per-key migration state.
VARIABLE readTs             \* Query read timestamp. Possible values:
                            \* - UninitializedTs: uninitialized.
                            \* - [InitialTimestamp, UntimestampedRead): provided timestamp.
                            \* - UntimestampedRead: untimestamped.
VARIABLE migrations         \* Ancillary variable limiting the number of migrations.

(* Router variables *)
VARIABLE routingAttempt         \* The number of routing routingAttempts for the query.
VARIABLE rCachedRoutingTable    \* The cached routing table. Lazily maintained from `routingTable'.
VARIABLE rCachedVersions        \* The placement versions associated with the cached routing table.
                                \* Lazily maintained from `versions'.

(* Config shard variables *)
VARIABLE routingTable       \* Timestamp-aware routing table.
VARIABLE versions           \* Latest placement version associated with the routing table.

VARIABLE sLatestTs          \* Latest timestamp.
VARIABLE sOwnership         \* Timestamp-aware, authoritative range ownership information.
VARIABLE sVersions          \* Latest placement version associated with the ownership.
VARIABLE sKeys              \* Timestamp-aware snapshot of the keys.
VARIABLE sCritSecEnterTs    \* The timestamp at which the critical section is durably entered. The
                            \* critical section implements per-namespace prepare state, disallowing
                            \* reads. Possible values:
                            \* - UninitializedTs: no critical section.
                            \* - (InitialTimestamp, UntimestampedRead): timestamp at which the
                            \*   current critical section is entered.

(* Query-specific shard variables *)
VARIABLE sCursorTs          \* The cursor's read timestamp. See `readTs' for possible values.
VARIABLE sFilter            \* Timestamp-aware ownership filter. Used to filter out keys not owned
                            \* by the shard at a given timestamp. Also acts as a range preserver.
VARIABLE sExamined          \* Keys examined by query execution. Includes unowned keys.
VARIABLE sReturned          \* Keys returned by query execution. returned = examined âˆ© filter.

\* Action: the recipient enters a namespace-wide prepare state.
\*
\* Note that prior to entering the prepare state, the participant drains all writes. This spec
\* glosses over write blocking because it exclusively models reads.
\*
\* In principle, the recipient shard doesn't necessarily have to enter this read-blocking prepare
\* state. In fact, some server versions implementing the weak authoritative shard model (e.g. 8.0)
\* do not. This increases the read availability, as a router that hasn't learned the new routing
\* version can continue to forward reads to a recipient that hasn't yet committed the migration;
\* only reads forwarded with the more recent version would make the shard wait until the new version
\* is installed.
\*
\* This specification introduces the critical section on the recipient as a possible implementation
\* of the strong authoritative shard model, to follow the principle that the shard should always be
\* aware of its ownership, as opposed to learning it from the outside (the router).
