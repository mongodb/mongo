\* The maximum number of oplog entries that can be created on the primary in one
\* action. For model-checking, this can be 1 or a small number.
CONSTANT MaxClientWriteSize = 2

\* The number of election terms to simulate during model-checking.
CONSTANT MaxTerm = 3

\* The longest oplog any server can reach during model-checking.
CONSTANT MaxLogLen = 3

\* The set of server IDs. Adjust to test different replica set sizes.
CONSTANT Server = {1, 2, 3}

INVARIANT NoTwoPrimariesInSameTerm

\* NeverRollbackCommitted and NeverRollbackBeforeCommitPoint can be violated,
\* although it's not ultimately a safety issue: SERVER-39626. The issue
\* requires at least 5 servers, 3 terms, and oplogs of length 4+, which are
\* larger limits than we can easily model-check.
