CONSTANT MaxClientWriteSize = 1

\* MaxTerm = 2 and MaxLogLen = 2 should complete in 10 minute.
\* MaxTerm = 3 and MaxLogLen = 3 should complete around 2.5 day.
\* The number of election terms to simulate during model-checking.
CONSTANT MaxTerm = 2

\* The longest oplog any server can reach during model-checking.
CONSTANT MaxLogLen = 2

\* The maximum number of restarts can happen during model-checking.
CONSTANT MaxRestartTimes = 1

\* The maximum number of failovers can happen during model-checking.
CONSTANT MaxFailoverTimes = 1

\* The set of server IDs. Adjust to test different replica set sizes.
CONSTANT Server = {n1, n2, n3}

INVARIANT NoTwoPrimariesInSameTerm

\* NeverRollbackCommitted and NeverRollbackBeforeCommitPoint can be violated,
\* although it's not ultimately a safety issue: SERVER-39626. The issue
\* requires at least 5 servers, 3 terms, and oplogs of length 4+, which are
\* larger limits than we can easily model-check.
