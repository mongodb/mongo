/**
 * The $rankFusion stage is syntactic sugar for generating an output of ranked results by combining
 * the results of any number of ranked subpipelines with reciprocal rank fusion.
 *
 * You can see an sample desugared pipeline in ranked_fusion_verbose_replace_root_test.js, but
 * conceptually, this stage, given n input pipelines each with a unique name, desugars into a
 * pipeline consisting of:
 * - The first input pipeline (e.g. $vectorSearch).
 * - $group, $unwind and $addFields that for each document returned will:
 *     - Add a rank field: <pipeline name>_rank (e.g. vs_rank).
 *     - Add a score field: <pipeline name>_score (e.g. vs_score).
 *         - Score is calculated with the formula 1 / (rank + rankConstant). Currently rankConstant
 *           is set to 60.
 * - n-1 $unionWith stages on the same collection, which take as input pipelines:
 *     - The nth input pipeline.
 *     - $group, $unwind and $addFields which do the same thing as described above.
 * - $group by ID and turn null scores into 0.
 * - $addFields for a 'score' field which will add the n scores for each document.
 * - $sort in descending order.
