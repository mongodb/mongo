                    If set to true, the change stream reader ignores shards that had
                    relevant change events allocated to them but have been removed from
                    the system. This makes the change stream to be read in
                    Ignore-Removed-Shards mode.
                    If set to false, the change stream reader fails if it cannot return
                    a change event because a shard that holds the event has been removed
                    from the system. This makes the change stream to be read in Strict mode.
