/**
 * This stage checks whether or not the oplog has enough history to resume the stream, and consumes
 * all events up to the given resume point. It is deployed on all shards when resuming a stream on
 * a sharded cluster, and is also used in the single-replicaset case when a stream is opened with
 * startAtOperationTime or with a high-water-mark resume token. It defers to the COLLSCAN to check
 * whether the first event (matching or non-matching) encountered in the oplog has a timestamp equal
 * to or earlier than the minTs in the change stream filter. If not, the COLLSCAN will throw an
 * assertion, which this stage catches and converts into a more comprehensible $changeStream
 * specific exception. The rules are:
 *
 * - If the first event seen in the oplog has the same timestamp as the requested resume token or
 *   startAtOperationTime, we can resume.
 * - If the timestamp of the first event seen in the oplog is earlier than the requested resume
 *   token or startAtOperationTime, we can resume.
 * - If the first entry in the oplog is a replica set initialization, then we can resume even if the
 *   token timestamp is earlier, since no events can have fallen off this oplog yet. This can happen
 *   in a sharded cluster when a new shard is added.
 *
 * - Otherwise we cannot resume, as we do not know if there were any events between the resume token
 *   and the first matching document in the oplog.
