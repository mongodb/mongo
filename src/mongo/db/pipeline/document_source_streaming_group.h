/**
 * This class represents streaming group implementation that can only be used when at least one of
 * _id fields is monotonic. It stores and output groups in batches. All groups in the batch has
 * the same value of monotonic id fields.
 *
 * For example, if the inputs are sorted by "x", we could use a batched streaming algorithm to
 * perform the grouping for {$group: {_id: {x: "$x", y: "$y"}}}.
 *
 * Groups are processes in batches. One batch corresponds to a set of groups when each monotonic
 * id field have the same value. Non-monotonic fields can have different values, so we still may
 * have multiple groups and even spill to disk, but we still consume significantly less memory
 * than general hash based group.
 * When a document with a different value in at least one group id field is encountered, it is
 * cached in '_firstDocumentOfNextBatch', current groups are finalized and returned in
 * subsequent getNext() called and when the current batch is depleted, memory is freed and the
 * process starts again.
 *
 * TODO SERVER-71437 Implement an optimization for a special case where all group fields are
 * monotonic
 * - we don't need any hashing in this case.
