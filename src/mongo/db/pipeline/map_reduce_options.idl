        description: >
            In version 4.2 and before, MongoDB MapReduce will not call the reduce function 
            for a key that has only a single value. In version 4.4 and later, the reduce 
            function is still called in order to validate the JavaScript reduce function 
            even when there is only one value. This setting will re-enable the old optimization.
