 * This stage's goal is twofold:
 * - Help satisfy the constraint of $scoreFusion to participate in hybrid search. A valid input
 *   to $scoreFusion (known as a scored selection pipeline) is forbidden from modifying the
 *   actual documents, so this stage aims to allow computing a new thing as metadata without
 *   being considered a modification.
 * - Provide a way to normalize input scores to the same domain (usually between 0 and 1).
