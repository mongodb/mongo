/** Mutable BSON Overview
 *
 *  Mutable BSON provides classes to facilitate the manipulation of existing BSON objects
 *  or the construction of new BSON objects from scratch in an incremental fashion. The
 *  operations (including additions, deletions, renamings, type changes and value
 *  modification) that are to be performed do not need to be known ahead of time, and do
 *  not need to occur in any particular order. This is in contrast to BSONObjBuilder and
 *  BSONArrayBuilder which offer only serialization and cannot revise already serialized
 *  data. If you need to build a BSONObj but you know upfront what you need to build then
 *  you should use BSONObjBuilder and BSONArrayBuilder directly as they will be faster and
 *  less resource intensive.
 *
 *  The classes in this library (Document, Element, and ConstElement) present a tree-like
 *  (or DOM like) interface. Elements are logically equivalent to BSONElements: they carry
 *  a type, a field name, and a value. Every Element belongs to a Document, which roots the
 *  tree, and Elements of proper type (mongo::Object or mongo::Array) may have child
 *  Elements of their own. Given an Element, you may navigate to the Element's parent, to
 *  its siblings to the left or right of the Element in the tree, and to the leftmost or
 *  rightmost children of the Element. Note that some Elements may not offer all of these
 *  relationships: An Element that represents a terminal BSON value (like an integer) will
 *  not have children (though it may well have siblings). Similarly, an Element that is an
 *  'only child' will not have any left or right siblings. Given a Document, you may begin
 *  navigating by obtaining the root Element of the tree by calling Document::root. See the
 *  documentation for the Element class for the specific navigation methods that will be
 *  available from the root Element.
 *
 *  Elements within the Document may be modified in various ways: the value of the Element
 *  may be changed, the Element may be removed, it may be renamed, and if it is eligible
 *  for children (i.e. it represents a mongo::Array or mongo::Object) it may have child
 *  Elements added to it. Once you have completed building or modifying the Document, you
 *  may write it back out to a BSONObjBuilder by calling Document::writeTo. You may also
 *  serialize individual Elements within the Document to BSONObjBuilder or BSONArrayBuilder
 *  objects by calling Element::writeTo or Element::writeArrayTo.
 *
 *  In addition to the above capabilities, there are algorithms provided in 'algorithm.h'
 *  to help with tasks like searching for Elements that match a predicate or for sorting
 *  the children of an Object Element.
 *
 *  Example 1: Building up a document from scratch, reworking it, and then serializing it:

     namespace mmb = mongo::mutablebson;
     // Create a new document
     mmb::Document doc;
     // doc contents: '{}'

     // Get the root of the document.
     mmb::Element root = doc.root();

     // Create a new mongo::NumberInt typed Element to represent life, the universe, and
     // everything, then push that Element into the root object, making it a child of root.
     mmb::Element e0 = doc.makeElementInt("ltuae", 42);
     root.pushBack(e0);
     // doc contents: '{ ltuae : 42 }'

     // Create a new empty mongo::Object-typed Element named 'magic', and push it back as a
     // child of the root, making it a sibling of e0.
     mmb::Element e1 = doc.makeElementObject("magic");
     root.pushBack(e1);
     // doc contents: '{ ltuae : 42, magic : {} }'

     // Create a new mongo::NumberDouble typed Element to represent Pi, and insert it as child
     // of the new object we just created.
     mmb::Element e3 = doc.makeElementDouble("pi", 3.14);
     e1.pushBack(e3);
     // doc contents: '{ ltuae : 42, magic : { pi : 3.14 } }'

     // Create a new mongo::NumberDouble to represent Plancks constant in electrovolt
     // micrometers, and add it as a child of the 'magic' object.
     mmb::Element e4 = doc.makeElementDouble("hbar", 1.239);
     e1.pushBack(e4);
     // doc contents: '{ ltuae : 42, magic : { pi : 3.14, hbar : 1.239 } }'

     // Rename the parent element of 'hbar' to be 'constants'.
     e4.parent().rename("constants");
     // doc contents: '{ ltuae : 42, constants : { pi : 3.14, hbar : 1.239 } }'

     // Rename 'ltuae' to 'answer' by accessing it as the root objects left child.
     doc.root().leftChild().rename("answer");
     // doc contents: '{ answer : 42, constants : { pi : 3.14, hbar : 1.239 } }'

     // Sort the constants by name.
     mmb::sortChildren(doc.root().rightChild(), mmb::FieldNameLessThan());
     // doc contents: '{ answer : 42, constants : { hbar : 1.239, pi : 3.14 } }'

     mongo::BSONObjBuilder builder;
     doc.writeTo(&builder);
     mongo::BSONObj result = builder.obj();
     // result contents: '{ answer : 42, constants : { hbar : 1.239, pi : 3.14 } }'

 *  While you can use this library to build Documents from scratch, its real purpose is to
 *  manipulate existing BSONObjs. A BSONObj may be passed to the Document constructor or to
 *  Document::make[Object|Array]Element, in which case the Document or Element will reflect
 *  the values contained within the provided BSONObj. Modifications will not alter the
 *  underlying BSONObj: they are held off to the side within the Document. However, when
 *  the Document is subsequently written back out to a BSONObjBuilder, the modifications
 *  applied to the Document will be reflected in the serialized version.
 *
 *  Example 2: Modifying an existing BSONObj (some error handling removed for length)

     namespace mmb = mongo::mutablebson;

     static const char inJson[] =
         "{"
         "  'whale': { 'alive': true, 'dv': -9.8, 'height': 50, attrs : [ 'big' ] },"
         "  'petunias': { 'alive': true, 'dv': -9.8, 'height': 50 } "
         "}";
     mongo::BSONObj obj = mongo::fromjson(inJson);

     // Create a new document representing the BSONObj with the above contents.
     mmb::Document doc(obj);

     // The whale hits the planet and dies.
     mmb::Element whale = mmb::findFirstChildNamed(doc.root(), "whale");
     // Find the 'dv' field in the whale.
     mmb::Element whale_deltav = mmb::findFirstChildNamed(whale, "dv");
     // Set the dv field to zero.
     whale_deltav.setValueDouble(0.0);
     // Find the 'height' field in the whale.
     mmb::Element whale_height = mmb::findFirstChildNamed(whale, "height");
     // Set the height field to zero.
     whale_deltav.setValueDouble(0);
     // Find the 'alive' field, and set it to false.
     mmb::Element whale_alive = mmb::findFirstChildNamed(whale, "alive");
     whale_alive.setValueBool(false);

     // The petunias survive, update its fields much like we did above.
     mmb::Element petunias = mmb::findFirstChildNamed(doc.root(), "petunias");
     mmb::Element petunias_deltav = mmb::findFirstChildNamed(petunias, "dv");
     petunias_deltav.setValueDouble(0.0);
     mmb::Element petunias_height = mmb::findFirstChildNamed(petunias, "height");
     petunias_deltav.setValueDouble(0);

     // Replace the whale by its wreckage, saving only its attributes:
     // Construct a new mongo::Object element for the ex-whale.
     mmb::Element ex_whale = doc.makeElementObject("ex-whale");
     doc.root().pushBack(ex_whale);
     // Find the attributes of the old 'whale' element.
     mmb::Element whale_attrs = mmb::findFirstChildNamed(whale, "attrs");
     // Remove the attributes from the whale (they remain valid, but detached).
     whale_attrs.remove();
     // Add the attributes into the ex-whale.
     ex_whale.pushBack(whale_attrs);
     // Remove the whale object.
     whale.remove();

     // Current state of document:
     "{"
     "    'petunias': { 'alive': true, 'dv': 0.0, 'height': 50 },"
     "    'ex-whale': { 'attrs': [ 'big' ] } })"
     "}";

 * Both of the above examples are derived from tests in mutable_bson_test.cpp, see the
 * tests Example1 and Example2 if you would like to play with the code.
 *
 * Additional details on Element and Document are available in their class and member
 * comments.
 */

/** Document is the entry point into the mutable BSON system. It has a fairly simple
 *  API. It acts as an owner for the Element resources of the document, provides a
 *  pre-constructed designated root Object Element, and acts as a factory for new Elements,
 *  which may then be attached to the root or to other Elements by calling the appropriate
 *  topology mutation methods in Element.
 *
 *  The default constructor builds an empty Document which you may then extend by creating
 *  new Elements and manipulating the tree topology. It is also possible to build a
 *  Document that derives its initial values from a BSONObj. The given BSONObj will not be
 *  modified, but it also must not be modified elsewhere while Document is using it. Unlike
 *  all other calls in this library where a BSONObj is passed in, the one argument Document
 *  constructor *does not copy* the BSONObj's contents, so they must remain valid for the
 *  duration of Documents lifetime. Document does hold a copy of the BSONObj itself, so it
 *  will up the refcount if the BSONObj internals are counted.
 *
 *  Newly constructed Elements formed by calls to 'makeElement[Type]' methods are not
 *  attached to the root of the document. You must explicitly attach them somewhere. If you
 *  lose the Element value that is returned to you from a 'makeElement' call before you
 *  attach it to the tree then the value will be unreachable. Elements in a document do not
 *  outlive the Document.
 *
 *  Document provides a convenience method to serialize all of the Elements in the tree
 *  that are reachable from the root element to a BSONObjBuilder. In general you should use
 *  this in preference to root().writeTo() if you mean to write the entire
 *  Document. Similarly, Document provides wrappers for comparisons that simply delegate to
 *  comparison operations on the root Element.
 *
 *  A 'const Document' is very limited: you may only write its contents out or obtain a
 *  ConstElement for the root. ConstElement is much like Element, but does not permit
 *  mutations. See the class comment for ConstElement for more information.
