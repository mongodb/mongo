/**
 * Performs a hash-based aggregation. Appears as the "group" stage in debug output. Groups the input
 * based on the provided vector of group-by slots, 'gbs'. The 'aggs' parameter is a map from
 * 'SlotId' to a pair of expressions, where the first expression is an optional initializer,
 * and the second expression aggregates the incoming rows. This defines a set of output slots whose
 * values will be computed based on the corresponding aggregate expressions. Each distinct grouping
 * will produce a single output, consisting of the values of the group-by keys and the results of
 * the aggregate functions.
 *
 * Since the data must be buffered in a hash table, this is a "binding reflector". This means slots
 * from the 'input' tree are not visible higher in tree. Stages higher in the tree can only see the
 * slots holding the group-by keys as well as those holding the corresponding aggregate values.
 *
 * The optional 'seekKeys', if provided, limit the results returned from the hash table only to
 * those equal to seekKeys.
 *
 * The 'optimizedClose' flag controls whether we can close the child subtree right after building
 * the hash table. If true it means that we do not expect the subtree to be reopened.
 *
 * The optional 'collatorSlot', if provided, changes the definition of string equality used when
 * determining whether two group-by keys are equal. For instance, the plan may require us to do a
 * case-insensitive group on a string field.
 *
 * The 'allowDiskUse' flag controls whether this stage can spill. If false and the memory budget is
 * exhausted, this stage throws a query-fatal error with code
 * 'QueryExceededMemoryLimitNoDiskUseAllowed'. If true, then spilling is possible and the caller
 * must provide a vector of 'mergingExprs'. This is a vector of (slot, expression) pairs which is
 * symmetrical with 'aggs'. The slots are only visible internally and are used to store partial
 * aggregate values that have been recovered from the spill table. Each of the expressions is an agg
 * function which merges the partial aggregate value from this slot into the final aggregate value.
 * In the debug string output, the internal slots used to house the partial aggregates are printed
 * as a list of "spillSlots" and the expressions are printed as a parallel list of "mergingExprs".
 *
 * If 'forcedIncreasedSpilling' is true, then this stage will spill frequently even if the memory
 * limit is not reached. This is intended to be used in test contexts to exercise the otherwise
 * infrequently used spilling logic.
 *
 * Debug string representation:
 *
 *  group [<group by slots>] [slot_1 = expr_1, ..., slot_n = expr_n] [<seek slots>]?
 *      spillSlots[slot_1, ..., slot_n] mergingExprs[expr_1, ..., expr_n] reopen? collatorSlot?
 *  childStage
