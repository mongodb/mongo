 * A holder for "global" slots and accessors. These are used in a PlanStage tree but:
 *  - Cannot be made constants due to restrictions on the lifetime of such values (e.g., they're
 *    singleton instances owned somewhere else).
 *  - Can be changed in runtime outside of the PlanStage tree (e.g., a resume recordId changed by a
 *    PlanExecutor).
 *
 * A RuntimeEnvironment object is created once per an execution thread. That means that each
 * producer and consumer in a parallel plan will have their own compilation environment, with their
 * own slot accessors. However, slot accessors in each such environment will access shared data,
 * which is the same across all environments.
 *
 * To avoid data races, the values stored in the runtime environment are considered read-only when
 * used with a parallel plan. An attempt to change any slot with 'resetValue' will result in a user
 * exception.
 *
 * If the runtime environment is used in a serial plan, modification of the slots is allowed.
