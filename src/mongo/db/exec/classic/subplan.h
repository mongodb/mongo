 *   if there is a plan in the cache for shape C, then C is planned using the index tags
 *   obtained from the plan cache entry. If no cached plan is found for C, then a MultiPlanStage

 *   candidate plans, the winner is inserted into the plan cache and used to plan subsequent
 *   executions of C. These subsequent executions of shape C could be either as a clause in
 *   another rooted $or query, or shape C as its own query.
 *
 *   --Plans for entire rooted $or queries are neither written to nor read from the plan cache.
