/**
 * TrialStage runs a specified 'trial' plan for a given number of iterations, tracking the number of
 * times the plan advanced over that duration. If the ratio of advances to works falls below a given
 * threshold, then the trial results are discarded and the backup plan is adopted. Otherwise, we
 * consider the trial a success, and return the cached results of the trial phase followed by any
 * further results that the plan produces.
 *
 * If the trial plan hits EOF before the trial phase is complete, then it is considered a successful
 * trial and the cached results are returned. If the trial plan dies during the trial phase, we
 * consider it to have failed and adopt the backup plan instead.
 *
 * This stage differs from other stages that choose between plans in that it does not evaluate all
 * candidates; it evaluates one specific trial plan, and adopts the backup plan if it fails.
 * Currently, results from the trial period are discarded on failure. Future use cases may wish to
 * extend this class to have multiple policies on what to do in this scenario.
