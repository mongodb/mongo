/*
 * The MultiPlanRateLimiter controls the number of concurrent multiplannings per plan cache key (ie
 * query shape) to reduce the multiplanner's resource consumption and protect performance. Each rate
 * limited plan cache key is assigned a TicketHolder, which maintains and distributes tickets across
 * multiplan operations from a limited pool of tickets. The query shape and its paired TicketHolder
 * are maintained by the TicketTable, which tracks the query shapes the server has identified
 * as requiring multiplan rate limiting.
 *
 * The multiplanner's rate limit algorithm is as follows:
 *
 * 1. The server will only begin to rate limit multiplanning once the the number of concurrent
 * trialing multiplan candidates across all plan cache keys, passes the
 * internalQueryConcurrentMultiPlanningThreshold.
 *
 * 2. With that threshold surpassed, each thread must request one ticket per candidate plan from
 * that query shape's TicketHolderBefore performing the work of multiplanning in
 * MultiPlanStage::pickBestPlan().
 *
 * 3. Each TicketHolder maintains a number of ticket to ensure that number of concurrent
 * multi-planning candidate plans does not exceed
 * <internalQueryMaxConcurrentMultiPlanJobsPerCacheKey>. If the TicketHolder has a ticket available
 * for each candidate plan, the thread receives the tickets immediately and proceeds to multiplan.
 *
 * 4. If, however, no tickets are available, the thread must wait for the ticket before it can
 * proceed. In this case, the MultiPlanStage yields all resources before and while it waits for
 * tickets.
 *
 * 5. Once tickets are received, multiplanning resumes. When MultiPlanStage::pickBestPlan() returns,
 * the tickets go out of scope and are automatically released back to the TicketHolder's pool of
 * available tickets.
 *
 * 6. When a query shape's plan cache entry is promoted to active, the server will skip
 * multiplanning the next time it encounters said query shape. In other words, plan cache entry
 * activation indicates that the server no longer needs to rate limit multi planning for this query
 * shape. For this reason, in onPromoteCacheEntry(), we wake up all the threads associated with this
 * query shape that are waiting in step 4. We do this by resizing the query shape's associated
 * TicketHolder to the max size to ensure there are enough tickets for all the sleeping threads to
 * immediately receive tickets and proceed to multiplan. After this, we can remove the query shape's
 * entry from the MultiPlanRateLimiter's TicketTable.
