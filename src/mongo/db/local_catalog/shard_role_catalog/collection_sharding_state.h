 * functions for tracking this state.
 *
 * This is the only interface that non-sharding consumers should be interfacing with.
 *
 * On shard servers, the implementation used is CollectionShardingRuntime.

 * which is a mostly empty implementation.
 *
 * The CollectionShardingStateFactory class below is used to instantiate the correct subclass of
 * CollectionShardingState at runtime.

 * the respective collection. Different functions require different lock levels though, so be sure
