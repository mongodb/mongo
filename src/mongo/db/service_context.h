 * Used to mark operations that are not allowed to be killed by the stepdown thread.
 *
 * Do not add any new uses of unkillable operations without very careful deliberation. Improper
 * usage could lead to a deadlock, and plans are in place via SERVER-74658 to make as many
 * operations as possible killable.
 *
 * How does the operation killing process work?
 *   To be clear, an operation kill is actually an interruption. In order to get the RSTL lock
 *   lock during stepUp/stepDown, the replication coordinator will start a RstlKillOpThread to
 *   interrupt all threads that may block it for the RSTL lock. The RstlKillOpThread will loop
 *   through all threads and find out the threads that have ever taken a global lock in S/X/IX
 *   mode. It will interrupt these threads by interrupting their opCtx. Interrupting their opCtx
 *   will cause an InterruptedDueToReplStateChange error to be thrown when the thread checks for
 *   interruption on that opCtx.
 *
 *   In addition to threads holding global locks, a thread could also be interrupted if it:
 *   - is explicitly marked as alwaysInterruptAtStepDownOrUp, or if it
 *   - is waiting on prepare conflicts.
 *
 * What should I consider if I want to introduce a new thread?
 *   Does the new thread ever take any global lock in S/IX/X mode? If not, the stepdown thread
 *   won't interrupt the new thread, so we should leave it as killable. Even if the thread takes
 *   takes the global lock, the best practice should still be making the new thread killable and
 *   handling the interruption properly. It's always better to write the code in a way that can
 *   catch the InterruptedDueToReplStateChange error and recover from there, to avoid locking
 *   issues.
 *
 *   If the thread has to be unkillable, a comment must be left explaining the reason. This will
 *   help future diagnosability.
 *
 * TODO(SERVER-111752 SERVER-111753 SERVER-111754 SERVER-111755): Remove this type if all theads are
 * found to be killable.
