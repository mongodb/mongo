/**
 * Provides facilities for extracting oplog entries of writes in a particular namespace that needs
 * to be migrated.
 *
 * This also ensures that oplog returned are majority committed. This is achieved by calling
 * waitForWriteConcern. However, waitForWriteConcern does not support waiting for opTimes of
 * previous terms. To get around this, the waitForWriteConcern is performed in two phases:
 *
 * During init() call phase:
 * 1. Scan the entire config.transactions and extract all the lastWriteOpTime.
 * 2. Insert a no-op oplog entry and wait for it to be majority committed.
 * 3. At this point any writes before should be majority committed (including all the oplog
 *    entries that the collected lastWriteOpTime points to). If the particular oplog with the
 *    opTime cannot be found: it either means that the oplog was truncated or rolled back.
 *
 * New writes/xfer mods phase oplog entries:
 * In this case, caller is responsible for calling waitForWriteConcern. If getLastFetchedOplog
 * returns shouldWaitForMajority == true, it should wait for the highest opTime it has got from
 * getLastFetchedOplog. It should also error if it detects a change of term within a batch since
 * it would be wrong to wait for the highest opTime in this case.
