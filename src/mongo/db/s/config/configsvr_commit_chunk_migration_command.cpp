/**
 * This command takes the chunk being migrated ("migratedChunk") and generates a new version for it
 * that is written along with its new shard location ("toShard") to the chunks collection. It also
 * takes a control chunk ("controlChunk") and assigns it a new version as well so that the source
 * ("fromShard") shard's shardVersion will increases. If there is no control chunk, then the chunk
 * being migrated is the source shard's only remaining chunk.
 *
 * The new chunk version is generated by querying the highest chunk version of the collection, and
 * then incrementing that major value for both migrated and control chunks and setting the minor to
 * 0 for the migrated chunk and 1 for the control chunk. A global exclusive lock is held for the
 * duration of generating the new chunk version and writing to the chunks collection so that
 * yielding cannot occur. This assures that generated ChunkVersions are strictly monotonically
 * increasing -- a second process will not be able to query for max chunk version until the first
 * finishes writing the new highest chunk version it generated.
 *
 * Command Format:
 * {
 *   _configsvrCommitChunkMigration: <database>.<collection>,
 *   fromShard: "<from_shard_name>",
 *   toShard: "<to_shard_name>",
 *   migratedChunk: {min: <min_value>, max: <max_value>, etc. },
 *   controlChunk: {min: <min_value>, max: <max_value>, etc. },  (optional)
 *   fromShardCollectionVersion: { shardVersionField: <version> }, (for backward compatibility only)
 * }
 *
 * Returns:
 * {
 *   migratedChunkVersion: <ChunkVersion_BSON>,
 *   controlChunkVersion: <ChunkVersion_BSON>, (only present if a controlChunk is defined)
 * }
 *
