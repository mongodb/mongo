 * cancelled when the node is stepping down. Note that since the abortOrStepdown token is derived
 * from the stepdown token, it will be cancelled either when the node steps down or when abort() is
 * called. Users of this class are expected to store some information on their own in order to
 * differentiate between aborts and stepdowns (for example, by writing an abort reason to the state
 * document in the abort case).
