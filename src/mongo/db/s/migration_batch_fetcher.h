namespace mongo {


// This class is only instantiated on the destination of a chunk migration and
// has a single purpose: to manage two thread pools, one
// on which threads perform inserters, and one on which
// threads run _migrateClone requests (to fetch batches of documents to insert).
//
// The constructor creates and starts the inserter thread pool.  The destructor shuts down
// and joins the inserter thread pool.
//
// The main work of the class is in method fetchAndScheduleInsertion.  That method
// starts a thread pool for fetchers.  Each thread in that thread pool sits in a loop
// sending out _migrateClone requests, blocking on the response, and scheduling an
// inserter on the inserter thread pool.  This function joins and shuts down the
// fetcher thread pool once all batches have been fetched.
//
// Inserter is templated only to allow a mock inserter to exist.
// There is only one implementation of inserter currently, which is MigrationBatchInserter.
//
// A few things to note:
//  - After fetchAndScheduleInsertion returns, insertions are still being executed (although fetches
//    are not).
//  - Sending out _migrateClone requests in parallel implies the need for synchronization on the
//    source.  See the comments in migration_chunk_cloner_source.h for details around
//    that.
//  - The requirement on source side synchronization implies that care must be taken on upgrade.
//    In particular, if the source is running an earlier binary that doesn't have code for
//    source side synchronization, it is unsafe to send _migrateClone requests in parallel.
//    To handle that case, when the source is prepared to service _migrateClone requests in
//    parallel, the field "parallelMigrateCloneSupported" is included in the "_recvChunkStart"
//    command.  The inclusion of that field indicates to the destination that it is safe
//    to send _migrateClone requests in parallel.  Its exclusion indicates that it is unsafe.
