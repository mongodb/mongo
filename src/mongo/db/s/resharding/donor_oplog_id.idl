                    The oplog entry timestamp of the final oplog entry of a transaction. If the
                    operation is not from a transaction, then it is the same value as the ts field.

                description: >-
                    This is only set if this is a progress mark noop oplog entry created by the
                    oplog fetcher during the "applying" state. The increasing integer id is used
                    to differentiate a progress marker oplog entry from a regular oplog entry or
                    another progress marker oplog entry that corresponds to the same oplog entry
                    on the donor.
