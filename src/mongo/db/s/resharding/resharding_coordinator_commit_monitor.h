/**
 * Allows blocking the coordinator of a resharding operation until all recipient shards can finish
 * within a predefined threshold. The monitoring is achieved by periodically querying the estimated
 * remaining operation time for each recipient shard.
 *
 * The threshold is decided at the time of constructing a new `CoordinatorCommitMonitor`, and by
 * atomically fetching the value of `remainingReshardingOperationTimeThresholdMillis`.
 *
 * A cancellation token (i.e., `cancelToken`) is provided to each instance of
 * `CoordinatorCommitMonitor` and may be used for interruption. Once the monitor is interrupted, it
 * will make the returned `SemiFuture` ready.
 *
 * The monitor absorbs any internal error (e.g., cancellation errors) and always returns a ready
 * future to guarantee execution of any future chained to the returned `SemiFuture`.
 *
 * Internally, the monitor relies on the provided task executor to fulfill all its duties.
