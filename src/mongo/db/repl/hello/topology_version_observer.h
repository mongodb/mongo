 * An utility to observe topology changes asynchronously and cache updates.

 * execution of the constructor/destructor methods.
 *
 * The life-cycle for instances of this class (`_state`) is as follows:
 * * Uninitialized: immediately after construction.
 *   Call `init()` to initialize the instance and start the observer thread.
 *   You may only call `init()` once -- otherwise, it will terminate the process.
 * * Running: anytime after returning from `init()` and before calling `shutdown()`.
 *   Note that if the observer thread stops due to an error, it will set the state to Shutdown.
 * * Shutdown: the object is ready for destruction.
 *   You must wait for `shutdown()` to return before deleting the object.
 *   Multiple, multithreaded calls to `shutdown()` is safe, and only one will proceed.
 *   After transitioning to shutdown, you can only call the destructor.
 *
 * constructor() -> init() -> getCached() ... getCached() -> shutdown() -> destructor()
