/**
 * This interface provides helper functions for maintaining the documents used for
 * maintaining data consistency.
 *
 * The minValid document, in 'local.replset.minvalid', is used for indicating whether or not the
 * data on disk is consistent and for getting to a consistent point after unclean shutdown.
 *
 * Example of all fields:
 * {
 *      _id: <ObjectId>,                    // not used, but auto-generated
 *      ts: <Timestamp>,
 *      t: <long long>,                     // timestamp and term of minValid OpTime
 *      doingInitialSync: <bool>,
 *      begin: {
 *                  ts: <Timestamp>,
 *                  t: <long long>
 *             },                           // field for 'appliedThrough'
 * }
 *
 * The oplogTruncateAfterPoint document, in 'local.replset.oplogTruncateAfterPoint', is used to
 * indicate how much of the oplog is consistent and where the oplog should be truncated when
 * entering recovery.
 *
 * Example of all fields:
 * {
 *      _id: 'oplogTruncateAfterPoint',
 *      oplogTruncateAfterPoint: <Timestamp>
 * }
 *
 * See below for explanations of each field.
 *
 * The initialSyncId document, in 'local.replset.initialSyncId', is used to detect when nodes have
 * been resynced. It is set at the end of initial sync, or whenever replication is started when the
 * document does not exist.
 *
 * Example of all fields:
 * {
 *      _id: <UUID>,
 *      wallTime: <Date_t>
 * }
