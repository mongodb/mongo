/**
 * This structure stores information about a "speculative" majority read. Reads of this nature do
 * not rely on storage engine support for reading from a historical, majority committed snapshot.
 * Instead, they read from a local (uncommitted) snapshot of data, and, at the end of command
 * execution, block to ensure that any results returned are majority committed.
 *
 * We allow commands to optionally choose what timestamp to wait on. For example, if a command
 * generates a batch of data and it knows that the data doesn't reflect any operations newer than
 * timestamp T, it can set the "speculative majority timestamp" to T. This is an optimization that
 * can save unnecessary waiting.
 *
 * The basic theory of operation of this class is that once an operation has been marked as a
 * speculative majority read, it cannot be "unmarked" as such. Trying to mark it as speculative
 * again should have no effect. Once it has been marked as "speculative", a specific timestamp to
 * wait on can also be optionally provided. This read timestamp can be set multiple times, but every
 * new timestamp must be >= the previously set timestamp. This ensures that clients of this class
 * utilize it sensibly. The goal is to avoid a later caller invalidating the timestamp set by an
 * earlier caller, by setting the timestamp backwards. By enforcing the monotonicity of timestamps,
 * we ensure that waiting on any read timestamp of this class will always guarantee that previously
 * set timestamps are also majority committed. If no timestamp is ever set, then it is up to the
 * user of this structure to determine what timestamp to wait on so that data read is guaranteed to
 * be majority committed. This, for example, could be the timestamp of the read source chosen by the
 * storage engine.
