/**
 * DelayableTimeoutCallbackWithJitter is a slight variation on DelayableTimeoutCallback
 * which adds some additional random time to delays.  Since the callback may be delayed at
 * intervals much shorter than the random time, this would naively result in the timeout
 * either being moved backwards often, or if we forbid moving it backwards, ending up quickly
 * moving to the maximum jitter (which isn't very random).  To avoid that, we only recompute
 * the jitter every maximum jitter interval -- e.g. if the max jitter is 10 seconds and we
 * add 3 seconds jitter at time T, we will add 3 seconds jitter to every subsequent call until
 * time T + 10.
 *
 * The typical purpose of the jitter is to prevent two timers receiving delay calls at the same
 * times from firing at the same time.
 *
 * Synchronization of the randomSource is up to the caller; it is provided externally to
 * avoid having a separate random number generator per timer.  The randomSource function will
 * be called with the maximum jitter value passed to delayUntilWithJitter; it should return
 * a value in the range [0, maxJitter) or [0, maxJitter] depending on what you want the
 * actual jitter range to be.
