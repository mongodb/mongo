            Begins a migration blocking operation on a given namespace. Can only be
            called on the DB primary shard for that namespace. Must later call a
            corresponding _shardvrEndMigrationBlockingOperation with the same UUID and
            namespace to unblock migrations if this command is successful. Multiple
            migration blocking operations can be active on a single namespace
            simultaneously. As long as any operations are ongoing, chunk migrations
            will be disabled for that namespace.
