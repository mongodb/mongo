# ShardCollectionType type
#
# This type represents the layout and contents of documents contained in the shard server's
# config.cache.collections collection. All manipulation of documents coming from that collection
# should be done with this class.

# Expected shard server config.cache.collections collection format:

#      "_id" : "foo.bar",
#      "uuid" : UUID,                                   // optional in 3.6
#      "epoch" : ObjectId("58b6fd76132358839e409e47"),  // will remove when UUID becomes available
