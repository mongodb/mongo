# Holds extension-specific configuration information necessary to generate configuration files for passthrough tests.

# If a test extension does not require any unique configuration, no changes to this file are necessary. Notably,
# "sharedLibraryPath" should _not_ be included in this file. load_all_extensions() will generate correct configuration
# files for all loadable test extensions, including "sharedLibraryPath"s for both local and Evergreen runs.
