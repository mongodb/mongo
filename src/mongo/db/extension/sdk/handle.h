 * Handle is a wrapper around a pointer allocated by the host, whose ownership

 * pointer is determined by the IsOwned template parameter. When IsOwned is false, Handle acts as a
 * wrapper that abstracts the vtable and underlying pointer, but does not destroy the pointer when
 * it goes out of scope. When IsOwned is true, the pointer is owned by a unique_ptr and
 * automatically deallocates the associated memory when the Handle goes out of scope. Note, that
 * when a Handle owns the underlying memory, it only supports move semantics. Special care must be
 * taken to ensure the correct policy is assumed based on the context where the handle is used.
