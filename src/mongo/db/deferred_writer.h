/**
 * Provides an interface for asynchronously adding to a collection.
 *
 * Allows writes to a collection in a context without appropriate locks by buffering them in memory
 * and asynchronously writing them to the backing collection.  Useful when an operation with e.g. a
 * global MODE_S lock needs to write, but doesn't care that the write shows up immediately.
 * Motivated by the local health log.  For obvious reasons, cannot provide strong durability
 * guarantees, and cannot report whether the insert succeeded--in other words, this class provides
 * eventual "best effort" inserts.
 *
 * Because this class is motivated by the health log and errors cannot be cleanly reported to the
 * caller, it cannot report most errors to the client; it instead periodically logs any errors to
 * the system log.
 *
 * Instances of this class are unconditionally thread-safe, and cannot cause deadlock barring
 * improper use of the ctor, `flush` and `shutdown` methods below.
