     *    slightly different structs with the same name declared three different times.
     *  - Option 2:
     *    Create a query_stats_info.h that declares QueryStatsInfo--identical to the version defined
     *    in this file. CurOp/OpDebug, ClientCursor, and ClusterClientCursorImpl would then all
     *    have their own QueryStatsInfo instances, potentially as a unique_ptr or boost::optional. A
     *    benefit to this would be the ability to to just move the entire QueryStatsInfo struct from
     *    Op to the Cursor, instead of copying it over field by field (the current method). But:
     *      - The current code moves ownership of the key, but copies the keyHash. So, for workflows
     *        that require multiple cursors, like sharding, one cursor would own the key, but all
     *        cursors would have copies of the keyHash. The problem with trying to move around the
     *        struct in its entirety is that access to the *entire* struct would be lost on the
     *        move, meaning there's no way to retain the keyHash (that doesn't largely nullify the
     *        benefits of having the struct).
     *      - It seemed odd to have ClientCursor and ClusterClientCursorImpl using the struct but
     *        never needing other fields.
