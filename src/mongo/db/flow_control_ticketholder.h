 * would acquire a ticket when it begins an operation and release the ticket to the pool when the
 * operation is completed.
 *
 * In the context of flow control, clients take a ticket and do not return them to the pool. There
 * is an external service that calculates the maximum number of tickets that should be allotted for
 * the next time period (one second). The consumers will call `getTicket` and the producer will call
 * `refreshTo`.
