 * BasicFTSTokenizer
 * A iterator of "documents" where a document contains ASCII space (U+0020) delimited words.
 * Uses
 * - Tokenizer for tokenizing words via ASCII space (ie, U+0020 space).
 * - tolower from the C standard libary to lower letters, ie, it only supports lower casing
 * -     ASCII letters (U+0000 - U+007F)
 * - Stemmer (ie, Snowball Stemmer) to stem words.
 * - Embeded stop word lists for each language in StopWord class
 *
 * For each word returns a stem version of a word optimized for full text indexing.
 * Optionally supports returning case sensitive search terms.
 *
 * BasicFTSTokenizer does not implement the kGenerateDiacriticSensitiveTokens option. All tokens
 * generated by the BasicFTSTokenizer are ineherently diacritic sensitive.
