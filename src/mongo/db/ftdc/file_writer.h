 *  - The archive file is designed to write complete metric chunks.
 *  - The interim file writes smaller chunks in case of process failure.
 *
 * Note: This class never reads from the interim file. It is the callers responsibility to check
 * for unclean shutdown as this file. An unclean shutdown will mean there is valid data in the
 * interim file. If the shutdown is clean, the interim file will contain zeros as the leading
 * 8 bytes instead of a valid BSON length.
 *
 * The chunks in the archive stream will have better compression since it compresses larger chunks
 * of data.
 *
 * File format is compatible with mongodump as it is just a sequential series of bson documents
 *
 * File rotation and cleanup is not handled by this class.
