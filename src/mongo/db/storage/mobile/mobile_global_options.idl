            How often you want fsync data to disk. This is a trade-off between
            durability guarantees and performance. This value maps directly to
            SQLite's synchronous PRAGMA. The default value is 1 or NORMAL
            durability, where it's possible to have a write rolled back if the
            device crashes or loses power (you are always safe from
            application crashes). If write guarantees are more important than
            performance, set this to 2 or 3. Conversely, if you are fine with
            somewhat ephemeral local data then you can set this to 0.
