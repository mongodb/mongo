/**
 * A memory usage tracker class that aggregates memory statistics for the entire life of a query,
 * including the initial request and subsequent getMore() invocations. Stages that track memory will
 * report to an instance of this class, which in turn will update statistics in CurOp of the current
 * operation.
 *
 * Between commands, the tracker is stashed on the cursor (ClientCursor on mongod, or
 * ClusterClientCursor if we are on a router) if there is more data. The respective cursor manager
 * classes take care of the stashing (CursorManager on mongod, or ClusterCursorManager on the
 * router.)
 *
 * This class is instantiated on demand when building the stages, and its add() method is invoked as
 * early as the constructor (accumulators call 'add(sizeof(*this))' at construction time) and as
 * late as when destructors fire. Sometimes, on the router we have memory trackers for pipelines
 * that won't actually be executed, because the pipelines are executed in another process. We may
 * or may not have a valid opCtx pointer for these cases, and so will not report changes in memory
 * usage to the Curop instance. Since the memory amounts involved will be small and not for
 * pipelines that are actually executing, this is acceptable.
 *
 * For examples of correct usage of this class, see the C++ unit tests:
 * - RunAggregateTest: TransferOperationMemoryUsageTracker
 * - ClusterAggregateMemoryTrackingTest: MemoryTrackingWorksOnRouter
