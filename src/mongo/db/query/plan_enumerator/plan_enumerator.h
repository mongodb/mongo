     * Finds a set of predicates that can be safely compounded with the set

     * predicates to a compound, multikey index.
     *
     * The list of candidate predicates that we could compound is passed
     * in 'couldCompound'. A subset of these predicates that is safe to
     * combine by compounding is returned in the out-parameter 'out'.
     *
     * Does not take ownership of its arguments.
     *
     * The rules for when to compound for multikey indices are reasonably
     * complex, and are dependent on the structure of $elemMatch's used
     * in the query. Ignoring $elemMatch for the time being, the rule is this:
     *
     *   "Any set of predicates for which no two predicates share a path
     *    prefix can be compounded."
     *
     * Suppose we have predicates over paths 'a.b' and 'a.c'. These cannot
     * be compounded because they share the prefix 'a'. Similarly, the bounds
     * for 'a' and 'a.b' cannot be compounded (in the case of multikey index
     * {a: 1, 'a.b': 1}). You *can* compound predicates over the paths 'a.b.c',
     * 'd', and 'e.b.c', because there is no shared prefix.
     *
     * The rules are different in the presence of $elemMatch. For $elemMatch
     * {a: {$elemMatch: {<pred1>, ..., <predN>}}}, we are allowed to compound
     * bounds for pred1 through predN, even though these predicates share the
     * path prefix 'a'. However, we still cannot compound in the case of
     * {a: {$elemMatch: {'b.c': {$gt: 1}, 'b.d': 5}}} because 'b.c' and 'b.d'
     * share a prefix. In other words, what matters inside an $elemMatch is not
     * the absolute prefix, but rather the "relative prefix" after the shared
     * $elemMatch part of the path.
     *
     * A few more examples:
     *    1) {'a.b': {$elemMatch: {c: {$gt: 1}, d: 5}}}. In this case, we can
     *    compound, because the $elemMatch is applied to the shared part of
     *    the path 'a.b'.
     *
     *    2) {'a.b': 1, a: {$elemMatch: {b: {$gt: 0}}}}. We cannot combine the
     *    bounds here because the prefix 'a' is shared by two predicates which
     *    are not joined together by an $elemMatch.
     *
     * NOTE:
     *   Usually 'assigned' has just one predicate. However, in order to support
     *   mandatory predicate assignment (TEXT and GEO_NEAR), we allow multiple
     *   already-assigned predicates to be passed. If a mandatory predicate is over
     *   a trailing field in a multikey compound index, then we assign both a predicate
     *   over the leading field as well as the mandatory predicate prior to calling
     *   this function.
     *
     *   Ex:
     *      Say we have index {a: 1, b: 1, c: "2dsphere", d: 1} as well as a $near
     *      predicate and a $within predicate over "c". The $near predicate is mandatory
     *      and must be assigned. The $within predicate is not mandatory. Furthermore,
     *      it cannot be assigned in addition to the $near predicate because the index
     *      is multikey.
     *
     *      In this case the enumerator must assign the $near predicate, and pass it in
     *      in 'assigned'. Otherwise it would be possible to assign the $within predicate,
     *      and then not assign the $near because the $within is already assigned (and
     *      has the same path).

     *     of the paths X and Y causes the index to be multikey.
     *
     *   - For any $elemMatch predicate on path X already assigned to the index, it isn't safe to
     *     assign a predicate on path Y (possibly equal to X) to the index when
     *       (a) a shared prefix of the paths X and Y causes the index to be multikey and the

     *       (b) a shared prefix of the paths X and Y inside the innermost $elemMatch causes the
