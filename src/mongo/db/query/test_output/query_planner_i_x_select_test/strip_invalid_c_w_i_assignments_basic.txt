The expanded CWIs:
0: kp: { x: 1, y: 1 } sparse name: '(test_foo, y)'
1: kp: { x: 1, $_path: 1 } sparse name: '(test_foo, $_path)'

The expression assigned with the CWIs by rateIndices:
x $eq 10 || First: 0 1 notFirst: full path: x

Test that the invalid CWI assignment is stripped:
x $eq 10 || First: 1 notFirst: full path: x
