 * This is an implementation of the finding prime implicants step of the Quine–McCluskey algorithm.
 * Quine-McCluskey is a method used for minimizing boolean expressions. The function takes a maxterm
 * to simplify and returns the simplified maxterm (aka prime implicants) and a vector of indices of
 * covered input minterms by the corresponding derived minterms. The vector of covered input
 * minterms is supposed to be used in the next optimization step that calculates a minimal coverage.
 * See 'petricksMethod()' for details. For example, consider the following input ~A~B~C~D | ~A~B~CD
 * | ~AB~C~D | ~AB~CD | ~ABCD | A~BCD, which can be represented as the maxterm: [(0001, 1111),
 * (0100, 1111), (0101, 1111), (0111, 1111), (1011, 1111)], where the first bitset in every pair
 * represents predicates and the second one prepresents mask (see Maxtern and Minterm documentation
 * for details). The prime implicants for the expression will be A~BCD, ~ABD, ~A~C or represented as
 * minterms: [(1011, 1111), (0101, 1101), (0000, 1010)] and the input minterms coverage will be:
 * [5], [3, 4], [0, 1, 2, 3], which means that the first prime implicant A~BCD covers only the input
 * minterms with index 5, which has the same value A~BCD. And the second prime implicant ~ABD covers
 * input minterms with indexes 3 and 4 which are ~AB~CD, ~ABCD.
 * Indeed ~AB~CD | ~ABCD == ~ABD & (~C | C) == ~ABD.
