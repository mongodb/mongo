 * Encrypted range predicates are transmitted from the client to the server in $gt and $lt
 * operators. Since an encrypted payload is not divisible in to two separate BinData blobs where
 * only one operator actually contains the encrypted payload, while the other one acts as a stub.
 *
 * Users have the option of bypassing query analysis, generating encrypted payloads manually, and
 * manually constructing queries. This can lead to a situation where the user has generated payloads
 * for the query {x: {$gt: 23, $lte: 35}} => {x: {$gt: <payload for (23, 35]>, $lte: <stub>}}, but
 * then modifies the query so that {x: {$gte: <payload for (23, 35]>, $lte: <stub>}} is sent to the
 * server. Since the payloads are semantically opaque to the server, the results will be aligned
 * with the original query with $gt/$lte bounds, not the modified query with $gte/$lte bounds.
 *
 * The BinData blobs are generated with unique payloadIds that match a payload and stub together, as
 * well as indicate what MQL operator the blob was generated for. This validation pass uses that
 * information to ensure that payloads and stubs are properly matched with comparison operators so
 * that the visible syntax of a query matches with its encrypted semantics. In the case of a
 * mismatch, the server will return an error reminding the user to regenerate their encrypted
 * payloads for their new query.
