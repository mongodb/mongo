 * Expands arrays along the specified path and adds all elements to the 'elements' set.

 * and array elements.
 *
 * This function fills 'arrayComponents' with the positions (starting at 0) of 'path' corresponding
 * to array values.
 *
 * Some examples:
 *
 *   Consider the document {a: [{b: 1}, {b: 2}]} and the path "a.b". The elements {b: 1} and {b: 2}
 *   would be added to the set. 'arrayComponents' would be set as std::set<size_t>{0U}.
 *
 *   Consider the document {a: [{b: [1, 2]}, {b: [2, 3]}]} and the path "a.b". The elements {b: 1},
 *   {b: 2}, and {b: 3} would be added to the set and 'arrayComponents' would be set as
 *   std::set<size_t>{0U, 1U} if 'expandArrayOnTrailingField' is true. The elements {b: [1, 2]} and
 *   {b: [2, 3]} would be added to the set and 'arrayComponents' would be set as
