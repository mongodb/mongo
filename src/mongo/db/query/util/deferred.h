/**
 * A template class that provides a way to defer the initialization of an object until its value is
 * actually required. This is also commonly referred to as lazy initialization.
 *
 * Dangers:
 * - This implementation is currently not thread safe, and it shouldn't be used in multi-threaded
 *   fashion.
 * - Be careful about using this for lazy initialization of data members and capturing the 'this'
 *   variable. Code like this will result in buggy/unsafe move constructors, which would have a
 *   dangling reference to the moved-from type:
 *
 *   class MyType {
 *       int x;
 *       // !!! Dangling 'this' when moved !!!
 *       Deferred xSquared{[this]() { return this->x * this-> x; };
 *   };
 *   Instead, it is better to do something like this:
 *   class MyType {
 *       int xSquared() const {
 *          return *_xSquared.get(_x);
 *       }
 *
 *       int _x;
 *       Deferred _xSquared{[](int x) { return x * x; };
 *   };
 * - As a similar danger, the value is only computed once. if you initialize it with arguments like
 *   the above 'xSquared()' implementation, then be cogniscent that the value will never change. If
 *   '_x' changes, '_xSquared' will not.
 *
 * A Deferred class can be constructed with either an initial value (eager initialization) or a
 * function that will generate the value when needed.
 *
 * @tparam InitializerType Type of the "callable" object to invoke to generate a result.
 * @tparam ResultType Type of the result to generate on demand (deduced if possible).
