 * A C++ unit testing framework.
 *
 * For examples of basic usage, see mongo/unittest/unittest_test.cpp.
 *
 * It is inspired by Googletest, and shares some macro names with it, but be
 * advised that they are not the same thing, and macros like ASSERT have a
 * different meaning in this framework.
 *
 * For simplicity and for ease of maintenance, it is recommended that most tests
 * include this umbrella header rather than the specific parts of this
 * framework.
