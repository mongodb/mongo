    connPoolMaxConnsPerHost:
        description: >
            New in version 2.6.

            Available for both mongod and mongos.

            Sets the maximum size of the legacy connection pools for
            outgoing connections to other mongod instances in the global
            connection pool. The size of a pool does not prevent the
            creation of additional connections, but does prevent a
            connection pool from retaining connections in excess of the
            value of connPoolMaxConnsPerHost.

            Only adjust this setting if your driver does not pool
            connections and you're using authentication in the context of a
            sharded cluster.

        description: >
            New in version 3.6.3.

            Available for both mongod and mongos.

            Sets the maximum number of in-use connections at any given time
            for for outgoing connections to other mongod instances in the
            legacy global connection pool.

            By default, the parameter is unset.

            Sets the time limit that connection in the legacy global
            connection pool can remain idle before being closed.

            By default, the parameter is unset.
