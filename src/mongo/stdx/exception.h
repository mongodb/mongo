// This file provides a wrapper over the function registered by `std::set_terminate`.  This
// facilitates making `stdx::set_terminate` work correctly on windows.  In windows,
// `std::set_terminate` works on a per-thread basis.  Our `stdx::thread` header registers our
// handler using the `stdx::terminate_detail::TerminateHandlerInterface::dispatch` as an entry point
// for `std::set_terminate` when a thread starts on windows.  `stdx::set_terminate` sets the handler
// globally for all threads.  Our wrapper, which is registered with each thread, calls the global
// handler.
//
// NOTE: Our wrapper is not initialization order safe.  It is not safe to set the terminate handler
// until main has started.
