# The tests for `stdx::set_terminate` need to run outside of the mongo unittest harneses.
# The tests require altering the global `set_terminate` handler, which our unittest framework
# doesn't expect to have happen.  Further, the tests have to return successfully from a
# terminate condition which interacts poorly with the unittest framework.

# A set of dedicated binaries to each test case is actually the simplest way to accomplish
# robust testing of this mechanism.
