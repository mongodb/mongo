     * Use this function instead of wait/wait_for/wait_until to wait using `notifiable`.
     *
     * Waiting using `notifiable` means that:
     *  1) `cb` will be called to perform the wait, instead of calling
     *  std::condition_variable::wait. `cb` should return when `notify` is called on `notifiable`.
     *  2) The wait may be stopped because this condvar is notified, _or_ because `notifiable` was
     *  notified for some other reason (i.e. interrupt)
     *  3) Other work may be performed by the waiting thread before it yields; the logic for
     *  performing this work is encapsulated inside of `cb`; the only constraint is that it returns
     *  once notification has been performed on `notifiable`. Note that `notifiable` notificaton is
     *  a one-time event; once it is notified, all calls to this function will return immediately
     *  without waiting. See `Notifiable` and `ParkingLot` for more.
     *
     *  For example, passing `[baton] () { return baton->run(); }` as `cb` would be suitable when
     *  `baton` is also passed as `notifiable`, becuase `Baton::run` will return when the baton is
     *  notified.
