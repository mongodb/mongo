/**
 * A simple controller that allows for the maximum and minimum pool size to have dynamic values.
 * At construction, provide callables that return the current maximum and minimum sizes to be used
 * by the pool.
 *
 * Currently, the callables that provide the max and min are stateless and don't inspect any data
 * about the pool. The other pool parameters (maxConnecting, host/pending/refresh timeouts) are
 * simply taken from the Optoins the relevant ConnectionPool was started with. However, this
 * type is intended to be easily extensible to add these features in the future if needed.
