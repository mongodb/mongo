/**
 * An executor supporting cancellation via a cancellation token.  Given an existing
 * OutOfLineExecutor "exec" and a cancellation token "token", you can create a CancelableExecutor
 * using CancelableExecutor::make(exec, token). This executor will use "exec" to actually execute
 * any scheduled work, but will refuse to run any work after "token" has been cancelled.
 *
 * Refusal to run work is similar to any other executor's refusal: the callback is still
 * invoked, but with a non-OK status (the kCallbackCanceledErrorStatus defined below), and
 * in a different execution context than the one maintained by the executor (see the
 * class comment in out_of_line_executor.h for more details).
 *
 * Note: in cases where the CancelableExecutor will refuse to run a callback because it has been
 * cancelled, and the backing executor refuses to do the work for some other reason (i.e. shutdown),
 * the backing executor's error-status will be preferred and passed to the callback.
 *
 * This class can be used to manage ExecutorFuture chains; here's an example:
 *      ExecutorFuture(myExec)
 *          .then([] { return doThing1(); })
 *          .then([] { return doThing2(); })
 *          .thenRunOn(CancelableExecutor::make(myExec, myToken))
 *          .then([] { return doThing3(); })
 *          .thenRunOn(myExec)
 *          .then([] { return doThing4(); })
 *          .onError([](Status s) { return doThing5(s); })
 * In this example, doThing1 and doThing2 will run on myExec; doThing3()
 * will only run if myToken is not canceled when it is ready to run;
 * doThing4() will only run if doThing3() runs and completes without error;
 * doThing5 will run if doThing3() runs and errors _or_ if myToken was cancelled
 * before doThing3() ran -- in which case the status s passed to doThing5() will be
 * kCallbackCanceledErrorStatus.
