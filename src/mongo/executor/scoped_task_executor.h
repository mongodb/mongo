/**
 * Implements a scoped task executor which collects all callback handles it receives as part of
 * running operations and cancels any outstanding ones on destruction.
 *
 * The intent is that you can use this type with arbitrary task executor taking functions and allow
 * this object's destruction to clean up any methods which returned callback handles.
 *
 * Note that while this type provides access to a TaskExecutor*, certain methods are illegal to
 * call:
 * - startup()
 * - appendDiagnosticBSON()
 * - appendConnectionStats()
 * - dropConnections()
 *
 * And certain other methods only pass through this class to the underlying executor:
 * - makeEvent()
 *     will return a not-ok status after shutdown, but does not otherwise instrument the event
 * - signalEvent()
 *     always signals
 * - waitForEvent()
 *     always waits for the event
 * - cancel()
 *     always cancels the task
 * - wait()
 *     always waits for the task
 * - now()
 *     always returns the time
 *
 * This leaves the various callback handle returning methods + join/shutdown.  These methods, rather
 * than performing a passthrough, address only tasks dispatched through this executor, rather than
 * passing through to the underlying executor.
 *
 * Also note that this type DOES NOT call join in its dtor.  I.e. all tasks are cancelled, but all
 * callbacks may not have run when this object goes away.  You must call join() if you want that
 * guarantee.
