# Group related errors into categories,can be checked against ErrorCodes::isXXXClassName methods.
error_categories:
  - NetworkError
  - NetworkTimeoutError
  - Interruption
  # isNotPrimaryError() includes all codes that indicate that the node that received the request
  # was not primary at some point during command processing,regardless of whether some write may
  # have happened. If you care about whether a write could have happened,check for individual
  # codes.
  - NotPrimaryError
  - StaleShardVersionError
  - NeedRetargettingError
  - WriteConcernError
  - ShutdownError
  # isCancellationError() includes all codes that,when passed to a function as its parameter
  # indicates that it cannot be executed as normal and must abort its intended work.
  - CancellationError
  - ConnectionFatalMessageParseError
  - ExceededTimeLimitError
  - SnapshotError
  # isVoteAbortError() includes all error codes that a participant might return in response to the
  # prepare command sent by the coordinator during the two-phase commit protocol.
  # These error codes indicate that the coordinator should choose to abort the transaction.
  - VoteAbortError
  # isTwoPhaseDecisionAckError() includes all error codes that a participant may return in response
  # to the decision (abort/commit) sent by the coordinator during the two-phase commit protocol.
  # These codes indicate the participant has seen the decision before and forgotten the transaction,
  # so the coordinator treats them as successful acknowledgment.
  - TwoPhaseDecisionAckError
  - NonResumableChangeStreamError
  - RetriableError
  # isCloseConnectionError() includes all codes that indicate that it is no longer safe or
  # desirable to maintain a connection with the client. The server will close the connection to
  # get the client to through server selection again.
  - CloseConnectionError
  - VersionedAPIError
  - ValidationError
  # This category includes parsing errors caught by the IDL including unknown field, missing
  # field, and duplicate field.  It currently does not include all errors caught by the IDL.
  - IDLParseError
  # Atlas Stream Processing uses these error categories.
  - StreamProcessorUserError
  - StreamProcessorRetryableError
  # Codes for internal use only. The codes can be passed between servers in a cluster, but must
  # never be returned to the client in a network response.
  - InternalOnly
  - CursorInvalidatedError
  - PlannerEstimationError
  # This category contains all errors due to the system being under pressure
