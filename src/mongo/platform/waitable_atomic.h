 *  1) It supports extensions from P2643 including deadlines/timeouts
 *  2) It only supports 4-byte types to ensure a native implementation on linux
 *  3) We don't support customizing the memory order and always use seq_cst for the load.
 *
 * This is a lower-level type than WaitableAtomic. It should only be used if you have a 4-byte type
 * that has built-in tracking of whether there are any waiters. If both of those apply, this can
 * save a redundant atomic RMW in notify and wait. If not, look into the more flexible
 * WaitableAtomic class defined below.
 *
 * Note: We require unique object representations to avoid issues with padding bits and weirdness
 * with floats. If needed, we can lift this restriction using the same compiler-specific mechanisms
 * as std::atomic.
