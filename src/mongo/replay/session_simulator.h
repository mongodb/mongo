/**
 * SessionSimulator is a wrapper around ReplayCommandExecutor. The main difference between the two
 * is that SessionSimulator adds a simulation layer on top of ReplayCommandExecutor. This simulation
 * layers handles request timestamps or timestamps in general for initializing the simulation
 * itself. For example we may need to replay a very old session recorded for days and which not very
 * active. In this case an event can be recorded after hours of the previous one, but this won't
 * show up in the recording. So in this case we will get 2 events one after the other, but in
 * reality, to make the simulation as close as possible to the real execution, we will have to wait
 * a couple of hours before to run the command. So for this reason the current execution thread must
 * be put in sleep and resume later. ReplayCommandExecutor is a raw mongodb command executor, it
 * justs receives a bson, intrepets it in the correct way and sends it to the destination server,
 * where it is connected to. However, during a session simulation, we need to track when we started
 * and whether or not we want to simulate the execution of the current request right now.
 * SessionSimulator has a ReplayCommandExecutor, it does not inherit from it. We want to keep the
 * design as simple as possible. Performance is not very important in this case, however
 * SessionSimulator is not supposed to be thrown away and reconstructed constantly.
