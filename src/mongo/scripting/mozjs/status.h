 * The "MongoStatus" Javascript object.

 * This type wraps the "Status" type in the server, allowing for lossless throwing of mongodb native
 * exceptions through javascript.  It can be created (albeit without sidecar) from javascript.
 * These are also created automatically when exceptions are thrown from native c++ functions.
 *
 * They are somewhat special, in that the prototype for each MongoStatus object is actually an Error
 * object specific to that status object.  This allows Error-like behavior such as useful stack
 * traces, and instanceOf Error.
