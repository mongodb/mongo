# Optional.
# Using this special override extends FCV constant generation down to the previous value of
# lastLTS. This is intended to ease the transition to a new lastLTS by extending the lifetime
# of those older constants, so that they can be removed at a more convenient time.
# For example, we can set this to "5.0" when releasing "6.0".
