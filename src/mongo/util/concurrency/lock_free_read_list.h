/**
 * Note: This is a generic list with no dependency to `ServiceContext` or other core types, so it
 * is sitting in a separate header as a generic concurrency utility. However, it is optimized to
 * maintain the list of active `Client` objects, and may not be a drop-in for other use-cases.
 * Please make sure you review its documentation before using it for other use-cases.
 *
 * A synchronized linked list that allows lock-free iteration while serializing all modifications
 * (i.e. `add` and `remove`). The list has a few properties that allows lock-free iteration:
 *  - It is append-only and entires cannot be removed once added to the list. Instead, entries are
 *    logically deleted in response to a `remove` operation, and recycled for future inserts.
 *  - Readers do not block behind writers, but skip over a locked entry. Entries are only
 *    exclusively locked prior to being removed, and this data type assumes readers are not
 *    interested in observing removed entries.
 *  - A new entry is either atomically added as the new head of the list, or replaces a logically
 *    deleted entry atomically. This allows readers to observe new entries lock free.
 *
 * This class supports three operations:
 *  - `add` and `remove`: acquire exclusive write access to the list without blocking readers.
 *    `delete` may need to wait for readers to retire, since an entry can only be (logically)
 *    deleted when no reader has specified an intention to read its content (i.e. `Entry::pointer`).
 *  - `getCursor`: acquires a read-lock on the first valid (i.e. not logically deleted) entry in the
 *    list. If there is such an entry, it returns a cursor pointing to it. Otherwise, it returns an
 *    empty (invalid) cursor.
 *
 * Design Details: Readers and writers synchronize via a waitable atomic on each entry (`readers`).
 * Since the list is append-only, readers can safely access entries without any user-after-free
 * concerns. A write intent (there can only be one since writers have to exclusively lock the list)
 * is specified by setting the highest bit of the atomic.
