/**
 * Manages the relationship of our high-level ThreadNameRef strings to

 * changes. We try to apply temporary names to threads to make them
 * meaningful representations of the kind of work the thread is doing.
 * But sharing these names with the OS is slow and name length is limited.  So
 * ThreadNameInfo is an auxiliary resource to the OS thread name, available to
 * the LOGV2 system and to GDB.
 *
 * ThreadNameInfo are per-thread and managed by thread_local storage.
 *
 * A name is "active" when it has been pushed to the OS by `setHandle`. The
 * association can be abandoned by calling `release`. This doesn't affect the
 * OS, but indicates that the name binding is abandoned and shouldn't be
 * preserved by returning it from subsequent `setHandle` calls. We do however
 * retain the inactive reference in hopes of perhaps identifying redundant
 * `setHandle` calls that would set the OS thread name to the same value it
 * already has.
 *
 * Upon construction, a ThreadNameInfo has an inactive unique name that
 * the OS doesn't know about yet. A push/pop style call sequence of
 * `h=getHandle()` then (eventually) `setHandle(h)` can make this name
 * the active (known to the OS) thread name.
