     * throttled, it will not affect system availability or observability. Most operations, both
     * user and internal, should use this priority unless they qualify as 'kExempt'

     *
     * 'kLow': It's of low importance that the operation acquires a ticket. These low-priority
     * operations are reserved for background tasks that have no other operations dependent on them.
     * These operations may be throttled under load and make significantly less progress as compared
     * to operations of a higher priority.
     *
     * 'kExempt': It's crucial that the operation makes forward progress - bypasses the ticketing
     * mechanism.
     *
     * Reserved for operations critical to availability (e.g. replication workers) or observability
     * (e.g. FTDC), and any operation that is releasing resources (e.g. committing or aborting
     * prepared transactions). Should be used sparingly.
