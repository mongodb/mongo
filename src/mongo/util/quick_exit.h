/** The quickExit function will call ::_exit and not return. Use this instead of calling ::_exit
 *  directly:
 *   - It offers a debugger hook to catch the process before leaving code under our control.
 *   - For some builds (leak sanitizer) it gives us an opportunity to dump leaks.
 *
 *  The quickExit function is named differently than quick_exit so that we can distinguish it from
 *  the C++11 function of the same name.
 *
 *  The quickExitWithoutLogging function is the same as quickExit, except that it doesn't do any
 *  pre-exit checks that might result in logging. This explains why quickExit is implemented as an
 *  inline wrapper around quickExitWithoutLogging - the pre-exit checks and logging need to refer
 *  to mongo symbols, which aren't permitted in quick_exit.cpp.
