/**

 * code in modules foo, foo.bar, and foo.baz, but not by code in module qux.
 *
 * This is intended for cases where a module is split into submodules that each
 * have their own public and private APIs, but some submodules still want to
 * present APIs only to the parent module. Without this option, you would have
 * to choose between keeping the code in the parent module without the ability
 * to have its own private API, or making it public to all modules.
 *
 * This can only be used from a submodule (a module with a dot in its name).
 *
 * Note: this is defined to make the declaration visibile to the *direct* parent.
 * Because we currently only have one level of submodules, this is equivalent to
 * making it visible to the whole top-level module. If we ever have multiple levels
 * of submodules (eg query.opt.parser), we may want to allow specifying how far up
 * the hierarchy the declaration should be visible.
