 * functions in order to modify serialization/deserialization behavior based on caller context. This
 * is mainly used by the IDL generator, and allows us to pass this context through the nested types
 * to ensure it is available to the NamespacedStringUtil and DatabaseNameUtil serializers and
 * deserializers at any nested level.  However, it can also be used wherever code paths converge
 * such that hardcoding the specific serializer or deserializer doesn't make sense.
 *
 * The mechanism by which the IDL generated code passes these flags to its nested structs depends on
 * how the object is being constructed.  If parse() is called, the SerializationContext are stored
 * on the IDLParserContext to propagate to all nested structs, while direct construction requires
 * the SerializationContext to be passed in as constructor params.
