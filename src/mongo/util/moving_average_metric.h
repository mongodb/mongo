/**
 * This header defines `MovingAverageMetric`, which can be used with
 * `MetricBuilder` to define exponential moving average server status metrics.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *     #include "mongo/db/commands/server_status/server_status_metric.h"
 *     #include "mongo/util/moving_average_metric.h"
 *
 *     auto& someAverageMetricThing =
 *         *MetricBuilder<MovingAverageMetric>("some.averageMetricThing").bind(0.2);
 *
 * Then `someAverageMetricThing` is a `MovingAverageMetric` that you can call
 * `.addSample(double)` on. It has a smoothing factor of `0.2`. The smoothing
 * factor must be specified with `bind`, as above.
 *
 * Once `someAverageMetricThing.addSample` has been called at least once, the
 * metric "averageMetricThing" will appear in the "some" subsection of the
 * server status command response's "metrics" section, as might be seen in
 * `mongosh`:
 *
 *     test> db.runCommand({serverStatus: 1}).metrics.some
 *     {
 *       averageMetricThing: 2.34
 *     }
 *     test>
