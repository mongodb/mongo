/**
 *
 * A FailPoint is a hook mechanism allowing testing behavior to occur at prearranged
 * execution points in the server code. They can be activated and deactivated, and
 * configured to hold data.
 *
 * Failpoints are only available when set on the command line with
 * '--setParameter enableTestCommands=1'.
 * See FailPointRegistry::registerAllFailPointsAsServerParameters & docs/test_commands.md.
 *
 * A FailPoint is usually defined by the MONGO_FAIL_POINT_DEFINE(name) macro,
 * which arranges for it to be added to the global failpoint registry.
 *
 * A FailPoint object can have unusual lifetime semantics. It can be marked
 * `immortal`, so that its internal state is never destroyed. This is possible
 * because FailPoint is designed to have only trivially destructible nonstatic
 * data members, and we can choose not to manually destroy the internal state
 * object. This enables server code that is instrumented by an immortal
 * static-duration FailPoint to remain valid even during process shutdown.
 *
 * Sample use:
 *
 * // Defined somewhere:
 * MONGO_FAIL_POINT_DEFINE(failPoint);
 *
 * bool somewhereInTheCode() {
 *   ... do some stuff ...
 *   // The failpoint artificially changes the return value of this function when active.
 *   if (MONGO_unlikely(failPoint.shouldFail()))
 *       return false;
 *   return true;
 * }
 *
 * - or to implement more complex scenarios, use execute/executeIf -
 *
 * bool somewhereInTheCode() {
 *     failPoint.execute([&](const BSONObj& data) {
 *         // The bad things happen here, and can read the injected 'data'.
 *     });
 *     return true;
 * }
 *
 * // scoped() is another way to do it, where lambda isn't suitable, e.g. to cause
 * // a return/continue/break to control the enclosing function.
 * for (auto& user : users) {
 *     // The failpoint can be activated and given a user name, to skip that user.
 *     if (auto sfp = failPoint.scoped(); MONGO_unlikely(sfp.isActive())) {
 *         if (sfp.getData()["user"] == user.name()) {
 *             continue;
 *         }
 *     }
 *     processOneUser(user);
 * }
 *
 * // Rendered compactly with scopedIf where the data serves as an activation filter.
 * for (auto& user : users) {
 *     if (MONGO_unlikely(failPoint.scopedIf([&](auto&& o) {
 *         return o["user"] == user.name();
 *     }).isActive())) {
 *         continue;
 *     }
 *     processOneUser(user);
 * }
 *
 *  The `scopedIf` and `executeIf` members have an advantage over `scoped` and `execute`. They
 *  only affect the `FailPoint` activation counters (relevant to the `nTimes` and `skip` modes)
 *  if the predicate is true.
 *
 * A FailPoint can be configured remotely by a database command.
 * See `src/mongo/db/commands/fail_point_cmd.cpp`.
