/**
 * Escapes the special characters in 'str' for use as printable text.
 *
 * The backslash (`\`) character is escaped with another backslash, yielding the
 * 2-character sequence {`\`, `\`}.
 *
 * The single-byte control characters (octets 0x00-0x1f, 0x7f) are generally escaped
 * using the format "\xHH", where the 2 `H` characters are replaced by the 2 hex digits
 * of the octet. For instance, the octet 0x7f would yield the sequence: {`\`, `x`, `7`, `f`}.
 * Exemptions to this rule are the following octets, which are escaped using C-style escape
 * sequences:
 *   0x00  ->  {`\`, `0`}
 *   0x07  ->  {`\`, `a`}
 *   0x08  ->  {`\`, `b`}
 *   0x09  ->  {`\`, `t`}
 *   0x0a  ->  {`\`, `n`}
 *   0x0b  ->  {`\`, `v`}
 *   0x0c  ->  {`\`, `f`}
 *   0x0d  ->  {`\`, `r`}
 *   0x1b  ->  {`\`, `e`}
 *
 * The two-byte UTF-8 sequences between 0xC280 (U+0080) and 0xC29F (U+009F), inclusive, are
 * also escaped as they are considered control characters. The escape sequence for these has
 * the format: "\xC2\xHH", where the 2 `H` characters are replaced by the 2 hex digits of the
 * second octet.
 *
 * Invalid bytes found are replaced with the escape sequence following the format: "\xHH",
 * similar to how single-byte control characters are escaped.
 *
 * This writes the escaped output to 'buffer', and stops writing when either the output
 * length reaches the 'maxLength', or if appending the next escape sequence will cause the
 * output to exceed 'maxLength'. A 'maxLength' value of std::string::npos means unbounded.
 *
 * The 'wouldWrite' output is updated to contain the total bytes that would have been written
 * if there was no length limit.

 *
 * This differs from escapeForText in that the double-quote character (`"`) is escaped
 * with a backslash, yielding the 2-character sequence {`\`, `"`}.
 *
 * The general format of the escape sequences for single-byte control characters becomes
 * "\u00HH", where the 2 `H` characters are replaced by the 2 hex digits of the octet.
 * For example, the octet 0x7f would yield the sequence: {`\`, `u`, `0`, `0`, `7`, `f`}.
 * The list of octets escaped using C-style escape sequences is also shortened to:
 *   0x08  ->  {`\`, `b`}
 *   0x09  ->  {`\`, `t`}
 *   0x0a  ->  {`\`, `n`}
 *   0x0c  ->  {`\`, `f`}
 *   0x0d  ->  {`\`, `r`}
 * For two-byte control characters, the format of the escape sequence becomes "\uc2HH",
 * where the 2 `H` characters are replaced by the 2 hex digits of the second octet.
 * Invalid bytes found are replaced with the sequence: "\ufffd".
