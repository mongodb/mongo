/** An Environment is a map of values that can be validated according to a set of registered
 *  constraints
 *
 *  Usage overview:
 *
 *  1. Create an empty Environment
 *  2. Add Constraints
 *  3. Set Key/Value pairs (will not cause constraints to be triggered)
 *  4. Validate (will run all constraints)
 *  5. Access
 *  6. Set/Modify Key/Value pairs (will run all constraints and reject invalid modifications)
 *  7. Access
 *
 *  Since the constraints are run whenever we try to set or modify Key/Value pairs after we
 *  validate, we have the invariant that the Environment is always valid according to its
 *  Constraints after validation.  Adding new constraints is disallowed after validation.
 *
 *  Usage example:
 *
 *  // Create an empty Environment
 *  Environment environment;
 *
 *  // Initialize our first Key and Value
 *  Key key1("key1");
 *  Value value1(1);
 *
 *  // Add a Constraint on "key1"
 *  Status ret = environment.addConstraint(new ImmutableKeyConstraint("key1"));
 *  if (!ret.isOK()) {
 *      return ret;
 *  }
 *
 *  // Set our first Key and Value to the Environment
 *  ret = environment.set(key1, value1);
 *  if (!ret.isOK()) {
 *      return ret;
 *  }
 *
 *  // Attempt to mutate should be successful, since validate has not been called
 *  ret = environment.set(key1, Value(2));
 *  if (!ret.isOK()) {
 *      return ret;
 *  }
 *
 *  // Validate our Environment
 *  ret = environment.validate();
 *  if (!ret.isOK()) {
 *      return ret;
 *  }
 *
 *  // Access our Environment
 *  int intvalue1;
 *  ret = environment.get(key1, &intvalue1);
 *  if (!ret.isOK()) {
 *      return ret;
 *  }
 *
 *  // Attempt to mutate should fail, since validate has been called
 *  ret = environment.set(key1, Value(3));
 *  if (!ret.isOK()) {
 *      return ret;
 *  }
