GIT-INFO

This file is only present in git - never in release archives. It is used as a
sentinel file in buildconf.bat in order to differentiate a git checkout from
release and daily snapshot archives.

On *nix-like systems, run the ./buildconf script first to generate a fresh
configure script.  This requires autotools to be installed locally.
