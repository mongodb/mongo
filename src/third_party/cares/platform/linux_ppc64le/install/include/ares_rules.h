/*                    COMPILE TIME SANITY CHECKS                    */
/* ================================================================ */

/*
 * NOTE 1:
 * -------
 *
 * All checks done in this file are intentionally placed in a public
 * header file which is pulled by ares.h when an application is
 * being built using an already built c-ares library. Additionally
 * this file is also included and used when building the library.
 *
 * If compilation fails on this file it is certainly sure that the
 * problem is elsewhere. It could be a problem in the ares_build.h
 * header file, or simply that you are using different compilation
 * settings than those used to build the library.
 *
 * Nothing in this file is intended to be modified or adjusted by the
 * c-ares library user nor by the c-ares library builder.
 *
 * Do not deactivate any check, these are done to make sure that the
 * library is properly built and used.
 *
 * You can find further help on the c-ares development mailing list:
 * http://lists.haxx.se/listinfo/c-ares/
 *
 * NOTE 2
 * ------
 *
 * Some of the following compile time checks are based on the fact
 * that the dimension of a constant array can not be a negative one.
 * In this way if the compile time verification fails, the compilation
 * will fail issuing an error. The error description wording is compiler
 * dependent but it will be quite similar to one of the following:
 *
 *   "negative subscript or subscript is too large"
 *   "array must have at least one element"
 *   "-1 is an illegal array size"
 *   "size of array is negative"
 *
 * If you are building an application which tries to use an already
 * built c-ares library and you are getting this kind of errors on
 * this file, it is a clear indication that there is a mismatch between
 * how the library was built and how you are trying to use it for your
 * application. Your already compiled or binary library provider is the
 * only one who can give you the details you need to properly use it.
