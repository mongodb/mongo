SCons
is an extensible open source build system that orchestrates the construction of software (and other tangible products such as documentation files) by determining which component pieces must be built or rebuilt and invoking the necessary commands to build them\&.
SCons
offers many features to improve developer productivity such as parallel builds, caching of build artifacts, automatic dependency scanning, and a database of information about previous builds so details do not have to be recalculated each run\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
requires
Python
3\&.7 or later to run; there should be no other dependencies or requirements, unless the experimental Ninja tool is used (requires the ninja package)\&.
.PP

\fIChanged in version 4\&.3\&.0:\fR
support for
Python
3\&.5 is removed\&. The CPython project retired 3\&.5 in Sept 2020:
\m[blue]\fB\%https://peps.python.org/pep-0478\fR\m[]\&.
.PP

\fIChanged in version 4\&.8\&.0:\fR
support for
Python
3\&.6 is deprecated and will be removed in a future
SCons
release\&. The CPython project retired 3\&.6 in Sept 2021:
\m[blue]\fB\%https://peps.python.org/pep-0494\fR\m[]\&.
.PP

\fIChanged in version 4\&.9\&.0:\fR
support for
Python
3\&.6 is removed\&.
.PP
You set up an
SCons
build by writing a script that describes things to build (targets), and, if necessary, the rules to build those files (actions)\&.
SCons
comes with a collection of
Builder
methods which supply premade Actions for building many common software components such as executable programs, object files and libraries, so that for many software projects, only the targets and input files (sources) need be specified in a call to a builder\&.
.PP

SCons
operates at a level of abstraction above that of pure filenames\&. For example if you specify a shared library target named "foo",
SCons
keeps track of the actual operating system dependent filename (such as
libfoo\&.so
on a GNU/Linux system and
foo\&.dll
on Windows), and gives you a handle to refer to that target in other steps, so you don\*(Aqt have to use system\-specific strings yourself\&.
SCons
can also scan automatically for dependency information, such as header files included by source code files (for example,
#include
preprocessor directives in C or C++ files), so these
implicit dependencies
do not have to be specified manually\&.
SCons
supports the ability to define new scanners to support additional input file types\&.
.PP
Information about files involved in the build, including a cryptographic hash of the contents of source files, is cached for later reuse\&. By default, this hash (the
content signature) is used to decide if a file has changed since the last build, although other algorithms can be used by selecting an appropriate
\fBDecider\fR
function\&. Implicit dependency files are also part of out\-of\-date computation\&. The scanned implicit dependency information can optionally be cached and used to speed up future builds\&. A hash of each executed build action (the
build signature) is also cached, so that changes to build instructions (changing flags, etc\&.) or to the build tools themselves (e\&.g\&. a compiler upgrade) can also trigger a rebuild\&.
.PP

SCons
supports separated source and build directories (also called "out\-of\-tree builds") through the definition of
variant directories
Using a separated build directory helps keep the source directory clean of artifacts when doing searches, allows setting up differing builds ("variants") without conflicts, and allows resetting the build by just removing the build directory (note that SCons does have a "clean" mode as well)\&. See the
\fBVariantDir\fR
description for more details\&.
.PP
When invoked,
\fBscons\fR
looks for a file describing the build configuration in the current directory and reads that in\&. The file is by default named
SConstruct, although some variants of that, or a developer\-chosen name, are also accepted (see
the section called \(lqSConscript Files\(rq)\&. If found, the current directory is set as the project top directory\&. Certain command\-line options specify alternate places to look for
SConstruct
(see
\fB\-C\fR,
\fB\-D\fR,
\fB\-u\fR
and
\fB\-U\fR), which will set the project top directory to the path found\&. A path to the build configuration can also be specified with the
\fB\-f\fR
option, which leaves the current directory as the project top directory\&.
.PP
The build configuration may be split into multiple files: the
SConstruct
file can specify additional configuration files by calling the
\fBSConscript\fR
function, and any file thus invoked may include further files in the same way\&. By convention, these subsidiary files are named
SConscript, although any name may be used\&. As a result of this naming convention, the term
SConscript files
is used to refer generically to the complete set of configuration files for a project (including the
SConstruct
file), regardless of the actual file names or number of such files\&. A hierarchical build is not recursive \- all of the SConscript files are processed in a single pass so that
\fBscons\fR
has a picture of the complete dependency tree when it begins considering what needs building\&. Each SConscript file is processed in a separate context so settings made in one script do not leak into another; information can however be shared explicitly between scripts\&.
.PP
Before reading the SConscript files,
\fBscons\fR
looks for a
site directory
\- a directory named
site_scons
is searched for in various system directories and in the project top directory, or if the
\fB\-\-site\-dir\fR
option is given, checks only for that directory\&. Found site directories are prepended to the
Python
module search path (\fIsys\&.path\fR), thus allowing modules in such directories to be imported in the normal
Python
way in
SConscript
files\&. For each found site directory, (1) if it contains a file
site_init\&.py
that file is evaluated, and (2) if it contains a directory
site_tools
the path to that directory is prepended to the default toolpath\&. See the
\fB\-\-site\-dir\fR
and
\fB\-\-no\-site\-dir\fR
options for details on default paths and controlling the site directories\&.
.PP

SConscript
files are written in the
Python
programming language\&. For many tasks, the simple syntax can be understood from examples, so it is normally not necessary to be a
Python
programmer to use
SCons
effectively\&.
SConscript
files are executed in a context that makes the facilities described in this manual page directly available (that is, no need to
import)\&. Standard
Python
scripting capabilities such as flow control, data manipulation, and imported
Python
modules are available to use in more complicated build configurations\&. Other
Python
files can be made a part of the build system, but they do not automatically have the
SCons
context and need to import it if they need access (described later)\&.
.PP

SCons
reads and executes all of the included
SConscript
files
\fIbefore\fR
it begins building any targets\&. Progress messages show this behavior (the state change lines \- those beginning with the
scons:
tag \- may be suppressed using the
\fB\-Q\fR
option):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBscons foo\&.out\fR
scons: Reading SConscript files \&.\&.\&.
scons: done reading SConscript files\&.
scons: Building targets  \&.\&.\&.
cp foo\&.in foo\&.out
scons: done building targets\&.
$
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To assure reproducible builds,
SCons
uses a restricted
execution environment
for running external commands used to build targets, rather than propagating the full environment in effect at the time
\fBscons\fR
was called\&. This helps avoid problems like picking up accidental or malicious settings, temporary debug values that are no longer needed, or a developer having different settings than another (or than the CI pipeline)\&. Environment variables needed for the proper operation of such commands must be set in the execution environment explicitly, either by assigning the desired values, or by picking those values individually or collectively out of environment variables exposed by the
Python
os\&.environ
dictionary (as external program inputs they should be validated before use)\&. The execution environment for a given
construction environment
is its
\fB$ENV\fR
value\&. A small number of environment variables are picked up automatically by
\fBscons\fR
itself (see
the section called \(lqENVIRONMENT\(rq)\&.
.PP
In particular, if a compiler or other external command needed to build a target file is not in
\fBscons\fR\*(Aq idea of a standard system location, it will not be found at runtime unless you explicitly add the location into the execution environment\*(Aqs
\fIPATH\fR
element\&. This is a particular consideration on Windows platforms, where it is common for a command to install into an app\-specific location and depend on setting
\fIPATH\fR
in order for them to be found, which does not automatically work for
SCons\&.
.PP
One example approach is to extract the entire
\fBPATH\fR
environment variable and set that into the execution environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import os
env = Environment(ENV={\*(AqPATH\*(Aq: os\&.environ[\*(AqPATH\*(Aq]})
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Similarly, if the commands use specific external environment variables that
\fBscons\fR
does not recognize, they can be propagated into the execution environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import os

env = Environment(
    ENV={
        \*(AqPATH\*(Aq: os\&.environ[\*(AqPATH\*(Aq],
        \*(AqMODULEPATH\*(Aq: os\&.environ[\*(AqMODULEPATH\*(Aq],
        \*(AqPKG_CONFIG_PATH\*(Aq: os\&.environ[\*(AqPKG_CONFIG_PATH\*(Aq],
    }
)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Or you can explicitly propagate the invoking user\*(Aqs complete external environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import os
env = Environment(ENV=os\&.environ\&.copy())
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
This comes at the expense of making your build dependent on the user\*(Aqs environment being set correctly, but it may be more convenient for some configurations\&. It should not cause problems if done in a build setup which tightly controls how the environment is set up before invoking
\fBscons\fR, as in many continuous integration setups\&.
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}

.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
.PP
The above fragments are intended to illustrate a concept\&. It is normally not a good idea to wipe out the entire default value of the execution environment (env["ENV"]), as it may carry important information for the execution of build commands\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
\fBscons\fR
is normally executed in a top\-level directory containing an
SConstruct
file (the project top directory)\&. When
\fBscons\fR
is invoked, the command line (including the contents of the
\fBSCONSFLAGS\fR
environment variable, if set) is processed\&. Command\-line options (see
the section called \(lqOPTIONS\(rq) are consumed\&. Any variable argument assignments are collected, and remaining arguments are taken as targets to build\&.
.PP
Values of variables to be passed to the
SConscript
files may be specified on the command line:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons debug=1\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
These variables are available through the
\fIARGUMENTS\fR
dictionary, and can be used in the
SConscript
files to modify the build in any way:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
if ARGUMENTS\&.get("debug", ""):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS="\-g")
else:
    env = Environment()
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The command\-line variable arguments are also available in the
\fIARGLIST\fR
list, indexed by their order on the command line\&. This allows you to process them in order rather than by name, if necessary\&. Each
\fIARGLIST\fR
entry is a tuple consisting of the name and the value\&.
.PP
See
the section called \(lqCommand-Line Construction Variables\(rq
for more information\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
can maintain a cache of target (derived) files that can be shared between multiple builds\&. When derived\-file caching is enabled in an
SConscript
file, any target files built by
\fBscons\fR
will be copied to the cache\&. If an up\-to\-date target file is found in the cache, it will be retrieved from the cache instead of being rebuilt locally\&. Caching behavior may be disabled and controlled in other ways by the
\fB\-\-cache\-force\fR,
\fB\-\-cache\-disable\fR,
\fB\-\-cache\-readonly\fR, and
\fB\-\-cache\-show\fR
command\-line options\&. The
\fB\-\-random\fR
option is useful to prevent multiple builds from trying to update the cache simultaneously\&.
.PP
By default,
\fBscons\fR
searches for known programming tools on various systems and initializes itself based on what is found\&. On Windows systems which identify as
\fIwin32\fR,
\fBscons\fR
searches in order for the
Microsoft Visual C++
tools, the MinGW tool chain, the Intel compiler tools, the GCC tools, the LLVM/clang tools, and the PharLap ETS compiler\&. On Windows system which identify as
\fIcygwin\fR
(that is, if
\fBscons\fR
is invoked from a cygwin shell), the order changes to prefer the GCC toolchain over the MSVC tools\&.
On OS/2 systems,
\fBscons\fR
searches in order for the OS/2 compiler, the GCC tool chain, and the
Microsoft Visual C++
tools, On SGI IRIX, IBM AIX, Hewlett Packard HP\-UX, and Oracle Solaris systems,
\fBscons\fR
searches for the native compiler tools (MIPSpro, Visual Age, aCC, and Forte tools respectively) and the GCC tool chain\&. On all other platforms, including POSIX (Linux and UNIX) and macOS platforms,
\fBscons\fR
searches in order for the GCC tool chain, the LLVM/clang tools, and the Intel compiler tools\&. The default tool selection can be pre\-empted through the use of the
\fItools\fR
argument to
construction environment
creation methods, explicitly calling the
\fBTool\fR
loader, the through the setting of various setting of
construction variables\&.
.SS "Target Selection"
.PP
SCons
acts on the
selected targets, whether the requested operation is build, no\-exec or clean\&. Targets are selected as follows:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2
.\}
Targets specified on the command line\&. These may be files, directories, or phony targets defined using the
\fBAlias\fR
function\&. Directory targets are scanned by
\fBscons\fR
for any targets that may be found with a destination in or under that directory\&. The targets listed on the command line are made available in the
\fICOMMAND_LINE_TARGETS\fR
list\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
If no targets are specified on the command line,
\fBscons\fR
will select those targets specified in the
SConscript
files via calls to the
\fBDefault\fR
function\&. These are known as the
default targets, and are made available in the
\fIDEFAULT_TARGETS\fR
list\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  3." 4.2
.\}
If no targets are selected by the previous steps,
\fBscons\fR
selects the current directory for scanning, unless command\-line options which affect the directory for target scanning are present (\fB\-C\fR,
\fB\-D\fR,
\fB\-u\fR,
\fB\-U\fR)\&. Since targets thus selected were not the result of user instructions, this target list is not made available for direct inspection; use the
\fB\-\-debug=explain\fR
option if they need to be examined\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 4.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  4." 4.2
.\}

\fBscons\fR
always adds to the selected targets any intermediate targets which are necessary to build the specified ones\&. For example, if constructing a shared library or dll from C source files,
\fBscons\fR
will also build the object files which will make up the library\&.
.RE
.PP
To ignore the default targets specified through calls to
\fBDefault\fR
and instead build all target files in or below the current directory specify the current directory (\&.) as a command\-line target:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons \&.\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To build all target files, including any files outside of the current directory, supply a command\-line target of the root directory (on POSIX systems):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons /\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
or the path name(s) of the volume(s) in which all the targets should be built (on Windows systems):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons C:\e D:\e\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
A subset of a hierarchical tree may be built by remaining at the project top directory and specifying the subdirectory as the target to build:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons src/subdir\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
or by changing directory and invoking scons with the
\fB\-u\fR
option, which traverses up the directory hierarchy until it finds the
SConstruct
file, and then builds targets relatively to the current subdirectory (see also the related
\fB\-D\fR
and
\fB\-U\fR
options):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBcd src/subdir\fR
\fBscons \-u \&.\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
In all cases, more files may be built than are requested, as
\fBscons\fR
needs to make sure any dependent files are built\&.
.PP
Specifying "cleanup" targets in
SConscript
files is usually not necessary\&. The
\fB\-c\fR
flag removes all selected targets:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons \-c \&.\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
to remove all target files in or under the current directory, or:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons \-c build export\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
to remove target files under
build
and
export\&.
.PP
Additional files or directories to remove can be specified using the
\fBClean\fR
function in the
SConscript
files\&. Conversely, targets that would normally be removed by the
\fB\-c\fR
invocation can be retained by calling the
\fBNoClean\fR
function with those targets\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
supports building multiple targets in parallel via a
\fB\-j\fR
option that takes, as its argument, the number of simultaneous tasks that may be spawned:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons \-j 4\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
builds four targets in parallel, for example\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP

\fBscons\fR
supports the same command\-line options as GNU
Make
and many of those supported by
cons\&.

.sp
While clean mode removes targets rather than building them, work which is done directly in
Python
code in
SConscript
files will still be carried out\&. If it is important to avoid some such work from taking place in clean mode, it should be protected\&. An
SConscript

\fBGetOption\fR, as in the call
if GetOption("clean"):

SCons
will use its normal dependency mechanisms to decide if a test must be rebuilt or not\&.

This is the default behavior\&.
.RE

Set the size stack used to run threads to

Using a stack size that is too small may cause stack overflow errors\&. This usually shows up as segmentation faults that cause scons to abort before building anything\&. Using a stack size that is too large will cause scons to use more memory than required and may slow down the entire build process\&. The default value is to use a stack size of 256 kilobytes, which should be appropriate for most uses\&. You should not need to increase this value unless you encounter stack overflow errors\&.

.SH "SCONSCRIPT FILE REFERENCE"
.SS "SConscript Files"
.PP
The build configuration is described by one or more files, known as
SConscript
files\&. There must be at least one file for a valid build (\fBscons\fR
will quit if it does not find one)\&.
\fBscons\fR
by default looks for this file by the name
SConstruct
in the directory from which you run
\fBscons\fR, though if necessary, also looks for alternative file names
Sconstruct,
sconstruct,
SConstruct\&.py,
Sconstruct\&.py
and
sconstruct\&.py
in that order\&. A different file name (which can include a pathname part) may be specified via the
\fB\-f\fR
option\&. Except for the
SConstruct
file, these files are not searched for automatically; you add additional configuration files to the build by calling the
\fBSConscript\fR
function\&. This allows parts of the build to be conditionally included or excluded at run\-time depending on how
\fBscons\fR
is invoked\&.
.PP
Each
SConscript
file in a build configuration is invoked independently in a separate context\&. This provides necessary isolation so that different parts of the build don\*(Aqt accidentally step on each other\&. You have to be explicit about sharing information, by using the
\fBExport\fR
function or the
\fIexports\fR
argument to the
\fBSConscript\fR
function, as well as the
\fBReturn\fR
function in a called
SConscript
file, and consume shared information by using the
\fBImport\fR

.SS "Construction Environments"
.PP
A
Construction Environment
is the basic means by which you communicate build information to
SCons\&. A new
construction environment
is created using the
\fBEnvironment\fR
function:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment()
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Construction environment
attributes called
Construction Variables
may be set either by specifying them as keyword arguments when the object is created or by assigning them a value after the object is created\&. These two are nominally equivalent:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(FOO=\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq)
env[\*(AqFOO\*(Aq] = \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Note that certain settings which affect tool detection are referenced only when the tools are initialized, so you need either to supply them as part of the call to
\fBEnvironment\fR, or defer tool initialization\&. For example, initializing the
Microsoft Visual C++
version you wish to use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# initializes msvc to v14\&.1
env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION="14\&.1")

env = Environment()
# msvc tool was initialized to default, does not reinitialize
env[\*(AqMSVC_VERSION\*(Aq] = "14\&.1"

env = Environment(tools=[])
env[\*(AqMSVC_VERSION\*(Aq] = "14\&.1"
# msvc tool initialization was deferred, so will pick up new value
env\&.Tool(\*(Aqdefault\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
As a convenience,
construction variables
may also be set or modified by the
\fIparse_flags\fR
keyword argument during object creation, which has the effect of the
\fBenv\&.MergeFlags\fR
method being applied to the argument value after all other processing is completed\&. This is useful either if the exact content of the flags is unknown (for example, read from a control file) or if the flags need to be distributed to a number of
construction variables\&.
\fBenv\&.ParseFlags\fR
describes how these arguments are distributed to
construction variables\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(parse_flags=\*(Aq\-Iinclude \-DEBUG \-lm\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
This example adds \*(Aqinclude\*(Aq to the
\fB$CPPPATH\fR
construction variable, \*(AqEBUG\*(Aq to
\fB$CPPDEFINES\fR, and \*(Aqm\*(Aq to
\fB$LIBS\fR\&.
.PP
An existing
construction environment
can be duplicated by calling the
\fBenv\&.Clone\fR
method\&. Without arguments, it will be a copy with the same settings\&. Otherwise,
\fBenv\&.Clone\fR
takes the same arguments as
\fBEnvironment\fR, and uses the arguments to create a modified copy\&.
.PP

SCons
provides a special
construction environment
called the
Default Environment\&. The
default environment
is used only for global functions, that is, construction activities called without the context of a regular
construction environment\&. See
\fBDefaultEnvironment\fR
for more information\&.
.PP
By default, a new
construction environment
is initialized with a set of builder methods and
construction variables
that are appropriate for the current platform\&. The optional
\fIplatform\fR
keyword argument may be used to specify that the
construction environment
should be initialized for a different platform:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(platform=\*(Aqcygwin\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Specifying a platform initializes the appropriate
construction variables
in the environment to use and generate file names with prefixes and suffixes appropriate for that platform\&.
.PP
Note that the
win32
platform adds the
\fISystemDrive\fR
and
\fISystemRoot\fR
variables from the user\*(Aqs external environment to the
construction environment\*(Aqs
\fIENV\fR
dictionary\&. This is so that any executed commands that use sockets to connect with other systems will work on Windows systems\&.
.PP
The
\fIplatform\fR
argument may be a string value representing one of the pre\-defined platforms (aix,
cygwin,
darwin,
hpux,
irix,
os2,
posix,
sunos
or
win32), or a callable platform object returned by a call to
\fBPlatform\fR
selecting a pre\-defined platform, or it may be a user\-supplied callable, in which case the
\fBEnvironment\fR
method will call it to update the new
construction environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def my_platform(env):
    env[\*(AqVAR\*(Aq] = \*(Aqxyzzy\*(Aq

env = Environment(platform=my_platform)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Note that supplying a non\-default platform or custom function for initialization may bypass settings that should happen for the host system and should be used with care\&. It is most useful in the case where the platform is an alternative for the one that would be auto\-detected, such as
platform="cygwin"
on a system which would otherwise identify as
win32\&.
.PP
The optional
\fItools\fR
and
\fItoolpath\fR
keyword arguments affect the way tools available to the environment are initialized\&. See
the section called \(lqTools\(rq
for details\&.
.PP
The optional
\fIvariables\fR
keyword argument allows passing a
Variables
object which will be used in the initialization of the
construction environment
See
the section called \(lqCommand-Line Construction Variables\(rq
for details\&.
.SS "Tools"
.PP

SCons
has many included tool modules (more properly,
tool specification modules) which are used to help initialize the
construction environment
prior to building, and more can be written to suit a particular purpose, or added from external sources (a repository of contributed tools is available)\&. More information on writing custom tools can be found in the
Extending SCons
section and specifically
Tool Modules\&.
.PP
An
SCons
tool is only responsible for setup\&. For example, if an
SConscript
file declares the need to construct an object file from a C\-language source file by calling the
\fBObject\fR
builder, then a tool module representing an available C compiler needs to have run first, to set up that builder and all the
construction variables
it needs in the associated
construction environment\&. The tool itself is not called in the process of the build\&. Tool setup happens when a
construction environment
is constructed, and in the basic case needs no intervention \- platform\-specific lists of default tools are used to examine the specific capabilities of that platform and configure the environment, skipping those tools which are not applicable\&.
.PP
If necessary, a specific set of tools to initialize in an environment during creation may be specified using the optional keyword argument
\fItools\fR\&.
\fItools\fR
must be a list, even if there are one (or zero) tools\&. This is useful to override the defaults, to specify non\-default built\-in tools, and to cause added tools to be called:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqmsvc\*(Aq, \*(Aqlex\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The
\fItools\fR
argument overrides the default tool list, it does not add to it, so be sure to include all the tools you need\&. For example, if you are building a c/c++ program, you must specify a tool for at least a compiler and a linker, as in
tools=[\*(Aqclang\*(Aq, \*(Aqlink\*(Aq]\&.
.PP
If the
\fItools\fR
argument is omitted, or if
\fItools\fR
includes the reserved name
\*(Aqdefault\*(Aq, then
SCons
will auto\-detect usable tools, using the search path from the execution environment (that is,
\fI\fIenv\fR\fR\fI[\*(AqENV\*(Aq][\*(AqPATH\*(Aq]\fR) for looking up any external programs, and the platform name in effect to determine the default tools for that platform\&. Note the contents of
\fBPATH\fR
from the external environment
\fIos\&.environ\fR
is
\fInot\fR
used\&. Changing the
\fIPATH\fR
in the execution environment after the
construction environment
is constructed will not cause the tools to be re\-detected\&.
.PP
Tools can also be directly called by using the
\fBTool\fR
method (see below)\&.

docbook
.RS 4
This tool tries to make working with Docbook in
SCons
a little easier\&. It provides several toolchains for creating different output formats, like HTML or PDF\&. Contained in the package is a distribution of the Docbook XSL stylesheets as of version 1\&.76\&.1\&. As long as you don\*(Aqt specify your own stylesheets for customization, these official versions are picked as default\&.\&.\&.which should reduce the inevitable setup hassles for you\&.
.sp
Implicit dependencies to images and XIncludes are detected automatically if you meet the HTML requirements\&. The additional stylesheet
utils/xmldepend\&.xsl
by Paul DuBois is used for this purpose\&.
.sp
Note, that there is no support for XML catalog resolving offered! This tool calls the XSLT processors and PDF renderers with the stylesheets you specified, that\*(Aqs it\&. The rest lies in your hands and you still have to know what you\*(Aqre doing when resolving names via a catalog\&.
.sp
For activating the tool "docbook", you have to add its name to the Environment constructor, like this
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqdocbook\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
On its startup, the
docbook
tool tries to find a required
xsltproc
processor, and a PDF renderer, e\&.g\&.
fop\&. So make sure that these are added to your system\*(Aqs environment
\fBPATH\fR
and can be called directly without specifying their full path\&.
.sp
For the most basic processing of Docbook to HTML, you need to have installed
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

.ie n \{\

.RE

Rendering to PDF requires you to have one of the applications

Creating a HTML or PDF document is very simple and straightforward\&. Say
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqdocbook\*(Aq])
env\&.DocbookHtml(\*(Aqmanual\&.html\*(Aq, \*(Aqmanual\&.xml\*(Aq)
env\&.DocbookPdf(\*(Aqmanual\&.pdf\*(Aq, \*(Aqmanual\&.xml\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
to get both outputs from your XML source
manual\&.xml\&. As a shortcut, you can give the stem of the filenames alone, like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqdocbook\*(Aq])
env\&.DocbookHtml(\*(Aqmanual\*(Aq)
env\&.DocbookPdf(\*(Aqmanual\*(Aq)

.if n \{\

and get the same result\&. Target and source lists are also supported:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqdocbook\*(Aq])
env\&.DocbookHtml([\*(Aqmanual\&.html\*(Aq,\*(Aqreference\&.html\*(Aq], [\*(Aqmanual\&.xml\*(Aq,\*(Aqreference\&.xml\*(Aq])

The rules given above are valid for the Builders
\fBDocbookHtml\fR,
\fBDocbookPdf\fR,
\fBDocbookEpub\fR,
\fBDocbookSlidesPdf\fR
and
\fBDocbookXInclude\fR\&. For the
\fBDocbookMan\fR
transformation you can specify a target name, but the actual output names are automatically set from the
refname
entries in your XML source\&.
.sp
The Builders
\fBDocbookHtmlChunked\fR,
\fBDocbookHtmlhelp\fR
and
\fBDocbookSlidesHtml\fR
are special, in that:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

they create a large set of files, where the exact names and their number depend on the content of the source file, and
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
the main target is always named
index\&.html, i\&.e\&. the output name for the XSL transformation is not picked up by the stylesheets\&.
.RE
.sp
As a result, there is simply no use in specifying a target HTML name\&. So the basic syntax for these builders is always:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqdocbook\*(Aq])
env\&.DocbookHtmlhelp(\*(Aqmanual\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If you want to use a specific XSL file, you can set the additional
\fIxsl\fR
parameter to your Builder call as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.DocbookHtml(\*(Aqother\&.html\*(Aq, \*(Aqmanual\&.xml\*(Aq, xsl=\*(Aqhtml\&.xsl\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Since this may get tedious if you always use the same local naming for your customized XSL files, e\&.g\&.
html\&.xsl
for HTML and
pdf\&.xsl
for PDF output, a set of variables for setting the default XSL name is provided\&. These are:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf

DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTMLCHUNKED
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTMLHELP

DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_MAN
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_SLIDESPDF
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_SLIDESHTML
.fi
.if n \{\

and you can set them when constructing your environment:

The
qt3
tool supports the following operations:
.sp

\fBAutomatic moc file generation from header files\&.\fR
You do not have to specify moc files explicitly, the tool does it for you\&. However, there are a few preconditions to do so: Your header file must have the same basename as your implementation file and must stay in the same directory\&. It must have one of the suffixes
\&.h,
\&.hpp,
\&.H,
\&.hxx,
\&.hh\&. You can turn off automatic moc file generation by setting
\fB$QT3_AUTOSCAN\fR
to
\fBFalse\fR\&. See also the corresponding
\fBMoc\fR
Builder\&.
.sp

\fBAutomatic moc file generation from C++ files\&.\fR
As described in the Qt documentation, include the moc file at the end of the C++ file\&. Note that you have to include the file, which is generated by the transformation
${QT3_MOCCXXPREFIX}<basename>${QT3_MOCCXXSUFFIX}, by default
<basename>\&.mo\&. A warning is generated after building the moc file if you do not include the correct file\&. If you are using
\fBVariantDir\fR, you may need to specify
\fIduplicate=True\fR\&. You can turn off automatic moc file generation by setting
\fB$QT3_AUTOSCAN\fR
to
False\&. See also the corresponding
\fBMoc\fR
Builder\&.
.sp

\fBAutomatic handling of \&.ui files\&.\fR
The implementation files generated from
\&.ui
files are handled much the same as yacc or lex files\&. Each
\fB\&.ui\fR
file given as a source of
\fBProgram\fR,
\fBLibrary\fR
or
\fBSharedLibrary\fR
will generate three files: the declaration file, the implementation file and a moc file\&. Because there are also generated headers, you may need to specify
\fIduplicate=True\fR
in calls to
\fBVariantDir\fR\&. See also the corresponding
\fBUic\fR
Builder\&.

.SS "Builder Methods"
.PP
You tell
SCons
what to build by calling
Builders, functions which take particular action(s) to produce target(s) of a particular type (conventionally hinted at by the builder name, e\&.g\&.
\fBProgram\fR) from the specified source files\&. A builder call is a declaration:
SCons
enters the specified relationship into its internal dependency node graph, and only later makes the decision on whether anything is actually built, since this depends on command\-line options, target selection rules, and whether the target(s) are out\-of\-date with respect to the sources\&.
.PP

SCons
provides a number of builders, and you can also write your own (see
Builder Objects)\&. Builders are created dynamically at run\-time, often (though not always) by tools which determine whether the external dependencies for the builder are satisfied, and which perform the necessary setup (see
Tools)\&. Builders are attached to a
construction environment
as methods\&. The available builder methods are registered as key\-value pairs in the
\fB$BUILDERS\fR
attribute of the
construction environment, so the available builders can be examined\&. This example displays them for debugging purposes:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment()
print("Builders:", list(env[\*(AqBUILDERS\*(Aq]))
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Builder methods take two required arguments:
\fItarget\fR
and
\fIsource\fR\&. The
\fItarget\fR
and
\fIsource\fR
arguments can be specified either as positional arguments, in which case
\fItarget\fR
comes first, or as keyword arguments, using
\fItarget=\fR
and
\fIsource=\fR\&. Although both arguments are nominally required, if there is a single source and the target can be inferred the
\fItarget\fR
argument can be omitted (see below)\&. Builder methods also take a variety of keyword arguments, described below\&.
.PP
Because long lists of file names can lead to a lot of quoting in a builder call,
SCons
supplies a
\fBSplit\fR
global function and a same\-named environment method that splits a single string into a list, using strings of white\-space characters as the delimiter (similar to the
Python
string
\fBsplit\fR
method, but succeeds even if the input isn\*(Aqt a string)\&.
.PP
The following are equivalent examples of calling the
\fBProgram\fR
builder method:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, [\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq])
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, Split(\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq))
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, env\&.Split(\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq))
env\&.Program(source=[\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq], target=\*(Aqbar\*(Aq)
env\&.Program(target=\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, source=Split(\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq))
env\&.Program(target=\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, source=env\&.Split(\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq))
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, source=\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq\&.split())
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Sources and targets can be specified as a scalar or as a list, composed of either strings or nodes (more on nodes below)\&. When specifying path strings,
Python
follows the POSIX pathname convention: if a string begins with the operating system pathname separator (on Windows both the slash and backslash separator are accepted, and any leading drive specifier is ignored for the determination) it is considered an absolute path, otherwise it is a relative path\&. If the path string contains no separator characters, it is searched for as a file in the current directory\&. If it contains separator characters, the search follows down from the starting point, which is the top of the directory tree for an absolute path and the current directory for a relative path\&. The "current directory" in this context is the directory of the
SConscript
file currently being processed\&.
.PP

SCons
also recognizes a third way to specify path strings: if the string begins with the
\fB#\fR
character it is
top\-relative
\- it works like a relative path, but the search follows down from the project top directory rather than from the current directory\&. The
\fB#\fR
can optionally be followed by a pathname separator, which is ignored if found in that position\&. Top\-relative paths only work in places where
\fBscons\fR
will interpret the path (see some examples below)\&. To be used in other contexts the string will need to be converted to a relative or absolute path first\&.
.PP
Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# The comments describing the targets that will be built
# assume these calls are in a SConscript file in the
# a subdirectory named "subdir"\&.

# Builds the program "/tmp/bar" from "subdir/bar\&.c":
env\&.Program(\*(Aq/tmp/bar\*(Aq, \*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)

# An initial \*(Aq#\*(Aq or \*(Aq#/\*(Aq are equivalent; the following
# calls build the programs "foo" and "bar" (in the

# "subdir/bar\&.c", respectively:
env\&.Program(\*(Aq#foo\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq)
env\&.Program(\*(Aq#/bar\*(Aq, \*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)

# Builds the program "other/foo" (relative to the top\-level
# SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo\&.c":
env\&.Program(\*(Aq#other/foo\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq)

# This will not work, only SCons interfaces understand \*(Aq#\*(Aq,
# os\&.path\&.exists is pure Python:

    env\&.Append(CPPPATH=\*(Aq#inc\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
When the target shares the same base name as the source and only the suffix varies, and if the builder method has a suffix defined for the target file type, then the target argument may be omitted completely, and
\fBscons\fR
will deduce the target file name from the source file name\&. The following examples all build the executable program
\fBbar\fR
(on POSIX systems) or
\fBbar\&.exe\fR
(on Windows systems) from the
bar\&.c
source file:
.sp
.if n \{\

env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The optional
\fIsrcdir\fR
keyword argument specifies that all source file strings that are not absolute paths or top\-relative paths shall be interpreted relative to the specified
\fIsrcdir\fR\&. The following example will build the
build/prog
(or
build/prog\&.exe
on Windows) program from the files
src/f1\&.c
and
src/f2\&.c:
.sp
.if n \{\

.if n \{\

.PP
The optional
\fIparse_flags\fR
keyword argument causes behavior similar to the
\fBenv\&.MergeFlags\fR
method, where the argument value is broken into individual settings and merged into the appropriate
construction variables\&.
.sp
.if n \{\

This example adds \*(Aqinclude\*(Aq to the
\fB$CPPPATH\fR
construction variable, \*(AqEBUG\*(Aq to
\fB$CPPDEFINES\fR, and \*(Aqm\*(Aq to
\fB$LIBS\fR\&.
.PP
The optional
\fIchdir\fR
keyword argument specifies that the Builder\*(Aqs action(s) should be executed after changing directory\&. If the
\fIchdir\fR
argument is a path string or a directory Node, scons will change to the specified directory\&. If the
\fIchdir\fR
is not a string or Node and evaluates true, then
\fBscons\fR
will change to the target file\*(Aqs directory\&.

Python
only keeps one current directory location even if there are multiple threads\&. This means that use of the
\fIchdir\fR

\fInot\fR
work with the SCons

SCons
interfere with each other when they start changing directory\&.

Note that
SCons
will
\fInot\fR
automatically modify its expansion of
construction variables
like
\fB$TARGET\fR
and
\fB$SOURCE\fR
when using the
\fIchdir\fR
keyword argument\-\-that is, the expanded file names will still be relative to the project top directory, and consequently incorrect relative to the chdir directory\&. If you use the
\fIchdir\fR
keyword argument, you will typically need to supply a different command line using expansions like
${TARGET\&.file}
and
${SOURCE\&.file}
to use just the filename portion of the target and source\&.
.PP
Keyword arguments that are not specifically recognized are treated as
construction variable
overrides, which replace or add those variables on a limited basis\&. These overrides will only be in effect when building the target of the builder call, and will not affect other parts of the build\&. For example, if you want to specify some libraries needed by just one program:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.Program(\*(Aqhello\*(Aq, \*(Aqhello\&.c\*(Aq, LIBS=[\*(Aqgl\*(Aq, \*(Aqglut\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\

.PP
or generate a shared library with a non\-standard suffix:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.SharedLibrary(
    target=\*(Aqword\*(Aq,
    source=\*(Aqword\&.cpp\*(Aq,
    SHLIBSUFFIX=\*(Aq\&.ocx\*(Aq,
    LIBSUFFIXES=[\*(Aq\&.ocx\*(Aq],
)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Note that both the
\fB$SHLIBSUFFIX\fR
and
\fB$LIBSUFFIXES\fR
construction variables
must be set if you want
\fBscons\fR
to search automatically for dependencies on the non\-standard library names; see the descriptions of these variables for more information\&.
.PP
Although the builder methods defined by
\fBscons\fR
are, in fact, methods of a
construction environment
object, many may also be called without an explicit environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Program(\*(Aqhello\*(Aq, \*(Aqhello\&.c\*(Aq)
SharedLibrary(\*(Aqword\*(Aq, \*(Aqword\&.cpp\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
If called this way, the builder will internally use the
Default Environment
that consists of the tools and values that
\fBscons\fR
has determined are appropriate for the local system\&.
.PP
Builder methods that can be called without an explicit environment (indicated in the listing of builders below without a leading
\fIenv\&.\fR) may be called from custom
Python
modules that you import into an
SConscript
file by adding the following to the
Python
module:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
from SCons\&.Script import *
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
A builder
\fImay\fR
add additional targets beyond those requested if an attached
Emitter
chooses to do so (see
the section called \(lqBuilder Objects\(rq
for more information\&.
\fB$PROGEMITTER\fR
is an example)\&. For example, the GNU linker takes a command\-line argument
\fB\-Map=\fR\fB\fImapfile\fR\fR, which causes it to produce a linker map file in addition to the executable file actually being linked\&. If the
\fBProgram\fR
builder\*(Aqs emitter is configured to add this mapfile if the option is set, then two targets will be returned when you only provided for one\&.
.PP
For this reason, builder methods always return a
NodeList, a list\-like object whose elements are Nodes\&. Nodes are the internal representation of build targets or sources (see
the section called \(lqNode Objects\(rq
for more information)\&. The returned
NodeList
object can be passed to other builder methods as source(s) or to other
SCons
functions or methods where a path string would normally be accepted\&.
.PP
For example, to add a specific preprocessor define when compiling one specific object file but not the others:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
bar_obj_list = env\&.StaticObject(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq, CPPDEFINES=\*(Aq\-DBAR\*(Aq)
env\&.Program("prog", [\*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq, bar_obj_list, \*(Aqmain\&.c\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Using a Node as in this example makes for a more portable build by avoiding having to specify a platform\-specific object suffix when calling the
\fBProgram\fR
builder method\&.
.PP
The
NodeList
object is also convenient to pass to the
\fBDefault\fR
function, for the same reason of avoiding a platform\-specific name:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
tgt = env\&.Program("prog", ["foo\&.c", "bar\&.c", "main\&.c"])
Default(tgt)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Builder calls will automatically "flatten" lists passed as source and target, so they are free to contain elements which are themselves lists, such as
\fIbar_obj_list\fR
returned by the
\fBStaticObject\fR
call\&. If you need to manipulate a list of lists returned by builders directly in
Python
code, you can either build a new list by hand:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

Since builder calls return a list\-like object, not an actual
Python
list, it is not appropriate to use the
Python
add operator (+
or
+=) to append builder results to a
Python
list\&. Because the list and the object are different types,
Python
will not update the original list in place, but will instead create a new
NodeList
object containing the concatenation of the list elements and the builder results\&. This will cause problems for any other
Python
variables in your SCons configuration that still hold on to a reference to the original list\&. Instead, use the
Python
list
\fBextend\fR
method to make sure the list is updated in\-place\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
object_files = []

# Do NOT use += here:
#    object_files += Object(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
#
# It will not update the object_files list in place\&.
#
# Instead, use the list extend method:
object_files\&.extend(Object(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq))

Note that because the Builder call returns a

in the example) to get at the Node that actually represents the object file\&.

When trying to handle errors that may occur in a builder method, consider that the corresponding Action is executed at a different time than the
SConscript
file statement calling the builder\&. It is not useful to wrap a builder call in a
try
block, since success in the builder call is not the same as the builder itself succeeding\&. If necessary, a Builder\*(Aqs Action should be coded to exit with a useful exception message indicating the problem in the
SConscript
files \- programmatically recovering from build errors is rarely useful\&.
.PP
The following builder methods are predefined in the
SCons
core software distribution\&. Depending on the setup of a particular
construction environment
and on the type and software installation status of the underlying system, not all builders may be available in that
construction environment\&. Since the function calling signature is the same for all builders:

\fBCompilationDatabase\fR(), \fIenv\fR\&.CompilationDatabase()
.RS 4

\fBCompilationDatabase\fR
is a special builder which adds a target to create a JSON formatted compilation database compatible with
clang
tooling (see the
\m[blue]\fBLLVM specification\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2)\&. This database is suitable for consumption by various tools and editors who can use it to obtain build and dependency information which otherwise would be internal to
SCons\&. The builder does not require any source files to be specified, rather it arranges to emit information about all of the C, C++ and assembler source/output pairs identified in the build that are not excluded by the optional filter
\fB$COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER\fR\&. The target is subject to the usual
SCons
target selection rules\&.
.sp
If called with no arguments, the builder will default to a target name of
compile_commands\&.json\&.
.sp
If called with a single positional argument,
\fBscons\fR
will "deduce" the target name from that source argument, giving it the same name, and then ignore the source\&. This is the usual way to call the builder if a non\-default target name is wanted\&.
.sp
If called with either the
\fItarget=\fR
or
\fIsource=\fR
keyword arguments, the value of the argument is taken as the target name\&. If called with both, the
\fItarget=\fR
value is used and
\fIsource=\fR
is ignored\&. If called with multiple sources, the source list will be ignored, since there is no way to deduce what the intent was; in this case the default target name will be used\&.

Build a
Microsoft Visual C++
project file and solution file\&.
.sp
Builds a
Microsoft Visual C++
project file based on the version of Visual Studio (or to be more precise, of
MSBuild) that is configured: either the latest installed version, or the version specified by
\fB$MSVC_VERSION\fR
in the current
construction environment\&. For Visual Studio 6\&.0 a
\&.dsp
file is generated\&. For Visual Studio versions 2002\-2008, a
\&.vcproj
file is generated\&. For Visual Studio 2010 and later a
\&.vcxproj
file is generated\&. Note there are multiple versioning schemes involved in the Microsoft compilation environment \- see the description of
\fB$MSVC_VERSION\fR
for equivalences\&. Note
SCons
does not know how to construct project files for other languages (e\&.g\&.
\&.csproj
for C#,
\&.vbproj
for Visual Basic or
\&.pyproject
for Python)\&.
.sp
For the
\&.vcxproj
file, the underlying format is the MSBuild XML Schema, and the details conform to:
\m[blue]\fBhttps://learn\&.microsoft\&.com/en\-us/cpp/build/reference/vcxproj\-file\-structure\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2\&. The generated solution file enables Visual Studio to understand the project structure, and allows building it using
MSBuild
to call back to
SCons\&. The project file encodes a toolset version that has been selected by
SCons
as described above\&. Since recent Visual Studio versions support multiple concurrent toolsets, use
\fB$MSVC_VERSION\fR
to select the desired one if it does not match the
SCons
default\&. The project file also includes entries which describe how to call
SCons
to build the project from within Visual Studio (or from an
MSBuild
command line)\&. In some situations
SCons
may generate this incorrectly \- notably when using the
\fIscons\-local\fR
distribution, which is not installed in a way that that matches the default invocation line\&. If so, the
\fB$SCONS_HOME\fR
construction variable
can be used to describe the right way to locate the
SCons
code so that it can be imported\&.
.sp
By default, a matching solution file for the project is also generated\&. This behavior may be disabled by specifying
\fIauto_build_solution=0\fR
to the
\fBMSVSProject\fR
builder\&. The solution file can also be independently generated by calling the
\fBMSVSSolution\fR
builder, such as in the case where a solution should describe multiple projects\&. See the
\fBMSVSSolution\fR
description for further information\&.
.sp
The
\fBMSVSProject\fR
builder accepts several keyword arguments describing lists of filenames to be placed into the project file\&. Currently,
\fIsrcs\fR,
\fIincs\fR,
\fIlocalincs\fR,
\fIresources\fR, and
\fImisc\fR
are recognized\&. The names are intended to be self\-explanatory, but note that the filenames need to be specified as strings,
\fInot\fR
as
SCons
File Nodes (for example if you generate files for inclusion by using the
\fBGlob\fR
function, the results should be converted to a list of strings before passing them to
\fBMSVSProject\fR)\&. This is because Visual Studio and
MSBuild
know nothing about
SCons
Node types\&. Each of the filename lists are individually optional, but at least one list must be specified for the resulting project file to be non\-empty\&.
.sp
In addition to the above lists of values, the following values may be specified as keyword arguments:
.PP
\fItarget\fR
.RS 4
The name of the target
\&.dsp

\fIvariant\fR

The name of this particular variant\&. Except for Visual Studio 6 projects, this can also be a list of variant names\&. These are typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but really can be anything you want\&. For Visual Studio 7 projects, they may also specify a target platform separated from the variant name by a
|

SCons
and Microsoft Visual Studio understand projects in different ways, and the mapping is sometimes imperfect:
.sp
Because
SCons
always executes its build commands from the directory in which the
SConstruct
file is located, if you generate a project file in a different directory than the directory of the
SConstruct
file, users will not be able to double\-click on the file name in compilation error messages displayed in the Visual Studio console output window\&. This can be remedied by adding the
Microsoft Visual C++
\fB/FC\fR
compiler option to the
\fB$CCFLAGS\fR
variable so that the compiler will print the full path name of any files that cause compilation errors\&.
.sp
If the project file is only used to teach the Visual Studio project browser about the file layout there should be no issues, However, Visual Studio should not be used to make changes to the project structure, build options, etc\&. as these will (a) not feed back to the
SCons
description of the project and (b) be lost if
SCons
regenerates the project file\&. The SConscript files should remain the definitive description of the build\&.
.sp
If the project file is used to drive
MSBuild
(such as selecting "build" from the Visual Studio interface) you lose the direct control of target selection and command\-line options you would have if launching the build directly from
SCons, because these will be hard\-coded in the project file to the values specified in the
\fBMSVSProject\fR
call\&. You can regain some of this control by defining multiple variants, using multiple
\fBMSVSProject\fR
calls to arrange different build targets, arguments, defines, flags and paths for different variants\&.
.sp
If the build is divided into a solution with multiple
MSBuild
projects the mapping is further strained\&. In this case, it is important not to set Visual Studio to do parallel builds, as it will then launch the separate project builds in parallel, and
SCons
does not work well if called that way\&. Instead, you can set up the
SCons
build for parallel building \- see the
\fBSetOption\fR
function for how to do this with
\fInum_jobs\fR\&.

To use this tool you need to install the

import
of the package
This can be done via:
.sp

If called with no arguments, the builder will default to a target name of
ninja\&.build\&.
.sp
If called with a single positional argument,
\fBscons\fR
will "deduce" the target name from that source argument, giving it the same name, and then ignore the source\&. This is the usual way to call the builder if a non\-default target name is wanted\&.
.sp
If called with either the
\fItarget=\fR
or
\fIsource=\fR
keyword arguments, the value of the argument is taken as the target name\&. If called with both, the
\fItarget=\fR
value is used and
\fIsource=\fR
is ignored\&. If called with multiple sources, the source list will be ignored, since there is no way to deduce what the intent was; in this case the default target name will be used\&.

The file list to include in the package may be specified with the
\fIsource\fR
keyword argument\&. If omitted, the
\fBFindInstalledFiles\fR
function is called behind the scenes to select all files that have an
\fBInstall\fR,
\fBInstallAs\fR
or
\fBInstallVersionedLib\fR
Builder attached\&. If the
\fItarget\fR
keyword argument is omitted, the target name(s) will be deduced from the package type(s)\&.
.sp
The metadata comes partly from attributes of the files to be packaged, and partly from packaging
tags\&. Tags can be passed as keyword arguments to the
\fBPackage\fR
builder call, and may also be attached to files (or more accurately, Nodes representing files) with the
\fBTag\fR
function\&. Some package\-level tags are mandatory, and will lead to errors if omitted\&. The mandatory tags vary depending on the package type\&.
.sp
While packaging, the builder uses a temporary location named by the value of the
\fB$PACKAGEROOT\fR
variable \- the package sources are copied there before packaging\&.
.sp
Packaging example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(tools=["default", "packaging"])
env\&.Install("/bin/", "my_program")
env\&.Package(
    NAME="foo",
    VERSION="1\&.2\&.3",
    PACKAGEVERSION=0,
    PACKAGETYPE="rpm",
    LICENSE="gpl",
    SUMMARY="balalalalal",
    DESCRIPTION="this should be really really long",
    X_RPM_GROUP="Application/fu",
    SOURCE_URL="https://foo\&.org/foo\-1\&.2\&.3\&.tar\&.gz",
)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In this example, the target
/bin/my_program
created by the
\fBInstall\fR
call would not be built by default since it is not under the project top directory\&. However, since no
\fIsource\fR
is specified to the
\fBPackage\fR
builder, it is selected for packaging by the default sources rule\&. Since packaging is done using
\fB$PACKAGEROOT\fR, no write is actually done to the system\*(Aqs
/bin
directory, and the target
\fIwill\fR
be selected since after rebasing to underneath
\fB$PACKAGEROOT\fR
it is now under the top directory of the project\&.

\fBPCH\fR(), \fIenv\fR\&.PCH()
.RS 4
Builds a
Microsoft Visual C++
precompiled header\&. Calling this builder returns a list of two target nodes: the PCH as the first element, and the object file as the second element\&. Normally the object file is ignored\&. The
\fBPCH\fR
builder is generally used in conjunction with the
\fB$PCH\fR
construction variable
to force object files to use the precompiled header:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
env[\*(AqPCH\*(Aq] = env\&.PCH(\*(AqStdAfx\&.cpp\*(Aq)[0]

.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
This builder is specific to the PCH implementation in
Microsoft Visual C++\&. Other compiler chains also implement precompiled header support, but
\fBPCH\fR
does not work with them at this time\&. As a result, the builder is only generated into the construction environment when
Microsoft Visual C++
is being used as the compiler\&.
.sp
The builder only works correctly in a C++ project\&. The Microsoft implementation distinguishes between precompiled headers from C and C++\&. Use of the builder will cause the PCH generation to happen with a flag that tells
cl\&.exe
all of the files are C++ files; if that PCH file is then supplied when compiling a C source file,
cl\&.exe
will fail the build with a compatibility violation\&.
.sp
If possible, arrange the project so that a C++ source file passed to the
\fBPCH\fR
builder is not also included in the list of sources to be otherwise compiled in the project\&.
SCons
will correctly track that file in the dependency tree as a result of the
\fBPCH\fR
call, and (for MSVC 11\&.0 and greater) automatically add the corresponding object file to the link line\&. If the source list is automatically generated, for example using the
\fBGlob\fR
function, it may be necessary to remove that file from the list\&.

The target library file prefix, specified by the

(by default,
lib
on POSIX systems, nothing on Windows systems), and suffix, specified by the
\fB$SHLIBSUFFIX\fR
construction variable
(by default,

on Windows systems,

On some platforms, there is a distinction between a shared library (loaded automatically by the system to resolve external references) and a loadable module (explicitly loaded by user action)\&. For maximum portability, use the

If

.if n \{\

.sp
On a POSIX system, supplying a simple version string (no dots) creates exactly one symbolic link:
SHLIBVERSION="1"
would create (for example) library
libbar\&.so\&.1
and symbolic link
libbar\&.so\&. Supplying a dotted version string will create two symbolic links (irrespective of the number of segments in the version):
SHLIBVERSION="1\&.5\&.2"
for the same library would create library
libbar\&.so\&.1\&.5\&.2
and symbolic links
libbar\&.so
and
libbar\&.so\&.1\&. A Darwin (OSX) system creates one symlink in either case, for the second example the library would be
libbar\&.1\&.5\&.2\&.dylib
and the link would be
libbar\&.dylib\&.
.sp
On Windows systems, specifying the
\fIregister=1\fR
keyword argument will cause the
\&.dll

\fB$REGSVR\fR

(\fBregsvr32\fR
by default), and the flags passed are determined by
\fB$REGSVRFLAGS\fR\&. By default,
\fB$REGSVRFLAGS\fR

\fB\-fPIC\fR
for

When there is a difference, SCons will only allow shared objects to be linked into a shared library, and will use a different suffix for shared objects\&. On platforms where there is no difference, SCons will allow both normal (static) and shared objects to be linked into a shared library, and will use the same suffix for shared and normal (static) objects\&. The target object file prefix, specified by the

The last approach is perhaps the recommended one\&. It allows easily split internationalization/localization onto separate SCons scripts, where a script in source tree is responsible for translations (from sources to
PO
files) and script(s) under variant directories are responsible for compilation of
PO
to
MO
files to and for installation of
MO
files\&. The "gluing factor" synchronizing these two scripts is then the content of
LINGUAS
file\&. Note, that the updated
POT
and
PO
files are usually going to be committed back to the repository, so they must be updated within the source directory (and not in variant directories)\&. Additionally, the file listing of
po/
directory contains
LINGUAS
file, so the source tree looks familiar to translators, and they may work with the project in their usual way\&.

Such a setup produces
POT

In addition,
\fBscons\fR
automatically scans source files for various programming languages, so the dependencies do not need to be specified explicitly\&. By default, SCons can C source files, C++ source files, Fortran source files with

\&.fpp, or
\&.FPP
file extensions, and assembly language files with
\&.S

\fBObject\fR,
\fBStaticObject\fR

Builders by adding them to the

the section called \(lqScanner Objects\(rq
for more information about defining your own Scanner objects and using the
SourceFileScanner
object\&.
.SS "SCons Functions and Environment Methods"
.PP

SCons
provides a variety of
construction environment
methods and global functions to manipulate the build configuration\&. Often, a
construction environment
method and a global function with the same name exist for convenience\&. In this section, both forms are shown if the function can be called in either way\&. The documentation style for these is as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBFunction\fR(\fIarguments, [optional arguments, \&.\&.\&.]\fR)  # Global function
\fIenv\fR\&.Function(\fIarguments, [optional arguments, \&.\&.\&.]\fR)  # Environment method
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
In these function signatures, arguments in brackets ([]) are optional, and ellipses (\&.\&.\&.) indicate possible repetition\&. Positional vs\&. keyword arguments are usually detailed in the following text, not in the signature itself\&. The
Python
positional\-only (/) and keyword\-only (*) markers are not used\&.
.PP
When the
Python
keyword=value
style is shown, it can have two meanings\&. If the keyword argument is known to the function, the value is the default for that argument if it is omitted\&. If the keyword is unknown to the function, some methods treat it as a
construction variable
assignment; otherwise an exception is raised for an unknown argument\&.
.PP
A global function and a same\-named
construction environment
method have the same base functionality, with two key differences:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2
.\}

Construction environment
methods that change the environment act on the environment instance from which they are called, while the corresponding global function acts on a special \(lqhidden\(rq
construction environment
called the Default Environment\&. In some cases, the global function may take an initial argument giving the object to operate on\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
String\-valued arguments (including strings in list\-valued arguments) are subject to construction variable expansion by the environment method form; variable expansion is not immediately performed in the global function\&. For example,
\fBDefault(\*(Aq$MYTARGET\*(Aq)\fR
adds
\*(Aq$MYTARGET\*(Aq
to the list of default targets, while if the value in
\fIenv\fR
of
MYTARGET
is
\*(Aqmine\*(Aq,
\fBenv\&.Default(\*(Aq$MYTARGET\*(Aq\fR
adds
\*(Aqmine\*(Aq
to the default targets\&. For more details on
construction variable
expansion, see the
Construction variables
section\&.
.RE
.PP
Global functions are automatically in scope inside
SConscript
files\&. If your project adds
Python
modules that you include via the
Python
import
statement from an
SConscript
file, such code will need to add the functions to that module\(cqs global scope explicitly\&. You can do that by adding the following import to the
Python
module:
\fBfrom SCons\&.Script import *\fR\&.
.PP

SCons
provides the following
construction environment
methods and global functions\&. The list can be augmented on a project basis using
\fBAddMethod\fR
.PP
\fBAction\fR(\fIaction, [output, [var, \&.\&.\&.]] [key=value, \&.\&.\&.]\fR), \fIenv\fR\&.Action(\fIaction, [output, [var, \&.\&.\&.]] [key=value, \&.\&.\&.]\fR)
.RS 4
A factory function to create an Action object for the specified
\fIaction\fR\&. See the manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior\&.
.sp
Note that the
\fBenv\&.Action\fR
form of the invocation will expand
construction variables
in any argument strings, including the
\fIaction\fR
argument, at the time it is called using the
construction variables
in the
construction environment
through which
\fBenv\&.Action\fR
was called\&. The
\fBAction\fR
global function form delays all variable expansion until the Action object is actually used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBAddMethod\fR(\fIobject, function, [name]\fR), \fIenv\fR\&.AddMethod(\fIfunction, [name]\fR)

\fIfunction\fR
will be called with an instance object as the first argument as for other methods\&. If
\fIname\fR
is given, it is used as the name of the new method, else the name of
\fIfunction\fR
is used\&.
.sp
When the global function
\fBAddMethod\fR
is called, the object to add the method to must be passed as the first argument; typically this will be
\fBEnvironment\fR, in order to create a method which applies to all
construction environments
subsequently constructed\&. When called using the
\fBenv\&.AddMethod\fR
form, the method is added to the specified
construction environment
only\&. Added methods propagate through
\fBenv\&.Clone\fR

\fBAddOption\fR(\fIopt_str, \&.\&.\&., attr=value, \&.\&.\&.\fR)
.RS 4
Adds a local (project\-specific) command\-line option\&. One or more
\fIopt_str\fR
values are the strings representing how the option can be called, while the keyword arguments define attributes of the option\&. For the most part these are the same as for the
\fBOptionParser\&.add_option\fR
method in the standard Python library module
optparse, but with a few additional capabilities noted below\&. See the
\m[blue]\fBoptparse documentation\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[6]\d\s+2
for a thorough discussion of its option\-processing capabilities\&. All options added through
\fBAddOption\fR
are placed in a special "Local Options" option group\&.
.sp
In addition to the arguments and values supported by the
optparse
\fBadd_option\fR
method,
\fBAddOption\fR
allows setting the
\fInargs\fR
keyword value to a string
\*(Aq?\*(Aq
(question mark) to indicate that the option argument for that option string may be omitted\&. If the option string is present on the command line but has no matching option argument, the value of the
\fIconst\fR
keyword argument is produced as the value of the option\&. If the option string is omitted from the command line, the value of the
\fIdefault\fR
keyword argument is produced, as usual; if there is no
\fIdefault\fR
keyword argument in the
\fBAddOption\fR
call,
\fBNone\fR
is produced\&.
.sp

optparse
recognizes abbreviations of long option names, as long as they can be unambiguously resolved\&. For example, if
\fBadd_option\fR
is called to define a
\fB\-\-devicename\fR
option, it will recognize
\fB\-\-device\fR,
\fB\-\-dev\fR
and so forth as long as there is no other option which could also match to the same abbreviation\&. Options added via
\fBAddOption\fR
do not support the automatic recognition of abbreviations\&. Instead, to allow specific abbreviations, include them as synonyms in the
\fBAddOption\fR
call itself\&.
.sp
Once a new command\-line option has been added with
\fBAddOption\fR, the option value may be accessed using
\fBGetOption\fR
or
\fBenv\&.GetOption\fR\&. If the
\fIsettable=True\fR
argument was supplied in the
\fBAddOption\fR
call, the value may also be set later using
\fBSetOption\fR
or
\fBenv\&.SetOption\fR, if conditions in an
SConscript
file require overriding any default value\&. Note however that a value specified on the command line will
\fIalways\fR
override a value set in an SConscript file\&.
.sp

\fIChanged in 4\&.8\&.0\fR: added the
\fIsettable\fR
keyword argument to enable an added option to be settable via
\fBSetOption\fR\&.
.sp
Help text for an option is a combination of the string supplied in the
\fIhelp\fR
keyword argument to
\fBAddOption\fR
and information collected from the other keyword arguments\&. Such help is displayed if the
\fB\-h\fR
command line option is used (but not with
\fB\-H\fR)\&. Help for all local options is displayed under the separate heading
\fBLocal Options\fR\&. The options are unsorted \- they will appear in the help text in the order in which the
\fBAddOption\fR
calls occur\&.

\fIval\fR\&. Otherwise,
\fIval\fR
is combined with the existing value, possibly converting into an appropriate type which can hold the expanded contents\&. There are a few special cases to be aware of\&. Normally, when two strings are combined, the result is a new string containing their concatenation (and you are responsible for supplying any needed separation); however, the contents of
\fB$CPPDEFINES\fR
will be post\-processed by adding a prefix and/or suffix to each entry when the command line is produced, so
SCons
keeps them separate \- appending a string will result in a separate string entry, not a combined string\&. For
\fB$CPPDEFINES\fR\&. as well as
\fB$LIBS\fR, and the various
*PATH
variables,
SCons
will amend the variable by supplying the compiler\-specific syntax (e\&.g\&. prepending a
\-D
or
/D
prefix for
\fB$CPPDEFINES\fR), so you should omit this syntax when adding values to these variables\&. Examples (gcc syntax shown in the expansion of

Because
\fB$CPPDEFINES\fR
is intended for command\-line specification of C/C++ preprocessor macros, additional syntax is accepted when adding to it\&. The preprocessor accepts arguments to predefine a macro name by itself (\-DFOO

/DFOO

Appending a string
\fIval\fR
to a dictionary\-typed
construction variable
enters
\fIval\fR
as the key in the dictionary, and
None
as its value\&. Using a tuple type to supply a key\-value pair only works for the special case of

described above\&.
.sp
Although most combinations of types work without needing to know the details, some combinations do not make sense and
Python
raises an exception\&.
.sp
When using
\fBenv\&.Append\fR
to modify
construction variables
which are path specifications (conventionally, the names of such end in

\fIaction\fR
argument, at the time it is called using the

Direct
\fBscons\fR
to maintain a derived\-file cache in
\fIcache_dir\fR\&. The derived files in the cache will be shared among all the builds specifying the same
\fIcache_dir\fR\&. Specifying a
\fIcache_dir\fR
of
\fBNone\fR
disables derived file caching\&.
.sp
Calling the environment method
\fBenv\&.CacheDir\fR
limits the effect to targets built through the specified
construction environment\&. Calling the global function
\fBCacheDir\fR
sets a global default that will be used by all targets built through
construction environments
that do not set up environment\-specific caching by calling
\fBenv\&.CacheDir\fR\&.
.sp
Caching behavior can be configured by passing a specialized cache class as the optional
\fIcustom_class\fR
parameter\&. This class must be a subclass of
SCons\&.CacheDir\&.CacheDir\&.
SCons
will internally invoke the custom class for performing caching operations\&. If the parameter is omitted or set to
\fBNone\fR,
SCons
will use the default
SCons\&.CacheDir\&.CacheDir
class\&.
.sp
When derived\-file caching is being used and
\fBscons\fR
finds a derived file that needs to be rebuilt, it will first look in the cache to see if a file with matching
build signature
exists (indicating the input file(s) and build action(s) were identical to those for the current target), and if so, will retrieve the file from the cache\&.
\fBscons\fR
will report
Retrieved `file\*(Aq from cache
instead of the normal build message\&. If the derived file is not present in the cache,
\fBscons\fR
will build it and then place a copy of the built file in the cache, identified by its
build signature, for future use\&.
.sp
The
Retrieved `file\*(Aq from cache
messages are useful for human consumption, but less useful when comparing log files between
\fBscons\fR
runs which will show differences that are noisy and not actually significant\&. To disable, use the
\fB\-\-cache\-show\fR
option\&. With this option,
\fBscons\fR
changes printing to always show the action that would have been used to build the file without caching\&.
.sp
Derived\-file caching may be disabled for any invocation of
\fBscons\fR
by giving the
\fB\-\-cache\-disable\fR
command line option; cache updating may be disabled, leaving cache fetching enabled, by giving the
\fB\-\-cache\-readonly\fR
option\&.
.sp
If the
\fB\-\-cache\-force\fR
option is used,
\fBscons\fR
will place a copy of
\fIall\fR
derived files into the cache, even if they already existed and were not built by this invocation\&. This is useful to populate a cache the first time a
\fIcache_dir\fR
is used for a build, or to bring a cache up to date after a build with cache updating disabled (\fB\-\-cache\-disable\fR
or
\fB\-\-cache\-readonly\fR) has been done\&.
.sp
The
\fBNoCache\fR
method can be used to disable caching of specific files\&. This can be useful if inputs and/or outputs of some tool are impossible to predict or prohibitively large\&.

SCons
provides no facilities for managing the derived\-file cache\&. It is up to the developer to arrange for cache pruning, expiry, access control, etc\&. if needed\&.

In addition to the above already\-available functions, the
\fIfunction\fR
argument may be a
Python
function you supply\&. Such a function must accept the following four arguments:
.PP
\fIdependency\fR
.RS 4
The Node (file) which should cause the
\fItarget\fR
to be rebuilt if it has "changed" since the last time
\fItarget\fR
was built\&.
.RE
.PP
\fItarget\fR
.RS 4
The Node (file) being built\&. In the normal case, this is what should get rebuilt if the
\fIdependency\fR
has "changed\&."
.RE
.PP
\fIprev_ni\fR
.RS 4
Stored information about the state of the
\fIdependency\fR
the last time the
\fItarget\fR
was built\&. This can be consulted to match various file characteristics such as the timestamp, size, or
content signature\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIrepo_node\fR
.RS 4
If set, use this Node instead of the one specified by
\fIdependency\fR
to determine if the dependency has changed\&. This argument is optional so should be written as a default argument (typically it would be written as
\fIrepo_node=None\fR)\&. A caller will normally only set this if the target only exists in a Repository\&.
.RE
.sp
The
\fIfunction\fR
should return a value which evaluates
\fBTrue\fR
if the
\fIdependency\fR
has "changed" since the last time the
\fItarget\fR
was built (indicating that the target
\fIshould\fR
be rebuilt), and a value which evaluates
\fBFalse\fR
otherwise (indicating that the target should
\fInot\fR
be rebuilt)\&. Note that the decision can be made using whatever criteria are appropriate\&. Ignoring some or all of the function arguments is perfectly normal\&.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def my_decider(dependency, target, prev_ni, repo_node=None):
    return not os\&.path\&.exists(str(target))

\fBDefault\fR(\fItarget[, \&.\&.\&.]\fR), \fIenv\fR\&.Default(\fItarget[, \&.\&.\&.]\fR)
.RS 4
Specify default targets to the
SCons
target selection mechanism\&. Any call to
\fBDefault\fR
will cause
SCons
to use the defined default target list instead of its built\-in algorithm for determining default targets (see the manpage section "Target Selection")\&.
.sp

\fItarget\fR
may be one or more strings, a list of strings, a
NodeList
as returned by a Builder, or
\fBNone\fR\&. A string
\fItarget\fR
may be the name of a file or directory, or a target previously defined by a call to
\fBAlias\fR
(defining the alias later will still create the alias, but it will not be recognized as a default)\&. Calls to
\fBDefault\fR
are additive\&. A
\fItarget\fR
of
None
will clear any existing default target list; subsequent calls to
\fBDefault\fR
will add to the (now empty) default target list like normal\&.
.sp
Both forms of this call affect the same global list of default targets; the construction environment method applies construction variable expansion to the targets\&.
.sp
The current list of targets added using
\fBDefault\fR
is available in the
\fIDEFAULT_TARGETS\fR
list (see below)\&.
.sp
Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Default(\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq, \*(Aqbar\*(Aq, \*(Aqbaz\*(Aq)
env\&.Default([\*(Aqa\*(Aq, \*(Aqb\*(Aq, \*(Aqc\*(Aq])

.RE
.PP
\fBDefaultEnvironment\fR(\fI[key=value, \&.\&.\&.]\fR)
.RS 4
Instantiates and returns the global
construction environment
object\&. The
Default Environment
is used internally by
SCons
when executing a global function or the global form of a Builder method that requires access to a
construction environment\&.
.sp
On the first call, arguments are interpreted as for the
\fBEnvironment\fR
function\&. The
Default Environment
is a singleton; subsequent calls to
\fBDefaultEnvironment\fR
return the already\-constructed object, and any keyword arguments are silently ignored\&.
.sp
The
Default Environment
can be modified after instantiation, similar to other
construction environments, although some
construction environment
methods may be unavailable\&. Modifying the
Default Environment
has no effect on any other
construction environment, either existing or newly constructed\&.
.sp
It is not necessary to explicitly call
\fBDefaultEnvironment\fR\&.
SCons
instantiates the
default environment
automatically when the build phase begins, if has not already been done\&. However, calling it explicitly provides the opportunity to affect and examine its contents\&. Instantiation occurs even if nothing in the build system appears to use it, due to internal uses\&.
.sp
If the project
SConscript
files do not use global functions or Builders, a small performance gain may be achieved by calling
\fBDefaultEnvironment\fR
with an empty tools list (\fBDefaultEnvironment(tools=[])\fR)\&. This avoids the tool initialization cost for the
Default Environment, which is mainly of interest in the test suite where
\fBscons\fR
is launched repeatedly in a short time period\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDepends\fR(\fItarget, dependency\fR), \fIenv\fR\&.Depends(\fItarget, dependency\fR)
.RS 4
Specifies an explicit dependency; the
\fItarget\fR
will be rebuilt whenever the
\fIdependency\fR
has changed\&. Both the specified
\fItarget\fR
and
\fIdependency\fR
can be a string (usually the path name of a file or directory) or Node objects, or a list of strings or Node objects (such as returned by a Builder call)\&. This should only be necessary for cases where the dependency is not caught by a Scanner for the file\&.

\fIenv\fR\&.Detect(\fIprogs\fR)

\fIprogs\fR
that was found, or
\fBNone\fR\&. Executable is searched by checking the paths in the execution environment (\fIenv\fR[\*(AqENV\*(Aq][\*(AqPATH\*(Aq])\&. On Windows systems, additionally applies the filename suffixes found in the execution environment (\fIenv\fR[\*(AqENV\*(Aq][\*(AqPATHEXT\*(Aq]) but will not include any such extension in the return value\&.

Return an object containing

is omitted, all the

\fIvar\fR

are returned in a

The object returned by

construction variables
require special internal handling, and modifying them through the

object can bypass that handling and cause data inconsistencies\&. The primary use of

\fBExecute\fR
performs its action immediately, as part of the SConscript\-reading phase\&. There are no sources or targets declared in an

.RS 4
Exports variables for sharing with other SConscript files\&. The variables are added to a global collection where they can be imported by other SConscript files\&.
\fIvars\fR
may be one or more strings, or a list of strings\&. If any string contains whitespace, it is split automatically into individual strings\&. Each string must match the name of a variable that is in scope during evaluation of the current SConscript file, or an exception is raised\&.
.sp
A
\fIvars\fR
argument may also be a dictionary or individual keyword arguments; in accordance with
Python
syntax rules, keyword arguments must come after any non\-keyword arguments\&. The dictionary/keyword form can be used to map the local name of a variable to a different name to be used for imports\&. See the Examples for an illustration of the syntax\&.
.sp

\fBExport\fR
calls are cumulative\&. Specifying a previously exported variable will replace the previous value in the collection\&. Both local variables and global variables can be exported\&.
.sp
To use an exported variable, an SConscript must call
\fBImport\fR
to bring it into its own scope\&. Importing creates an additional reference to the object that was originally exported, so if that object is mutable, changes made will be visible to other users of that object\&.
.sp
Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf

\&.node
The node that was being built when the build failure occurred\&.
.sp

\&.status
The numeric exit status returned by the command or Python function that failed when trying to build the specified Node\&.
.sp

\&.errstr

\&.node
attribute\&. For example, if an attempt to build a target named
sub/dir/target

.RS 4
Returns a possibly empty list of Nodes (or strings) that match pathname specification
\fIpattern\fR\&.
\fIpattern\fR
can be absolute, top\-relative, or (most commonly) relative to the directory of the current
SConscript
file\&.
\fBGlob\fR
matches both files stored on disk and Nodes which
SCons
already knows about, even if any corresponding file is not currently stored on disk\&. The environment method form (\fBenv\&.Glob\fR) performs string substitution on
\fIpattern\fR
and returns whatever matches the resulting expanded pattern\&. The results are sorted, unlike for the similar
Python
glob\&.glob
function, to ensure build order will be stable\&.
.sp

For a literal match, wrap the metacharacter in brackets to escape the normal behavior\&. For example,
\*(Aq[?]\*(Aq
matches the character
\*(Aq?\*(Aq\&.
.sp
Filenames starting with a dot are specially handled \- they can only be matched by patterns that start with a dot (or have a dot immediately following a pathname separator character, or slash), they are not not matched by the metacharacters\&. Metacharacter matches also do not span directory separators\&.
.sp

\fBGlob\fR
understands repositories (see the
\fBRepository\fR
function) and source directories (see the
\fBVariantDir\fR
function) and returns a Node (or string, if so configured) match in the local (SConscript) directory if a matching Node is found anywhere in a corresponding repository or source directory\&.
.sp
If the optional
\fIondisk\fR
argument evaluates false, the search for matches on disk is disabled, and only matches from already\-configured File or Dir Nodes are returned\&. The default is to return Nodes for matches on disk as well\&.
.sp
If the optional
\fIsource\fR
argument evaluates true, and the local directory is a variant directory, then
\fBGlob\fR
returns Nodes from the corresponding source directory, rather than the local directory\&.
.sp
If the optional
\fIstrings\fR
argument evaluates true,
\fBGlob\fR
returns matches as strings, rather than Nodes\&. The returned strings will be relative to the local (SConscript) directory\&. (Note that while this may make it easier to perform arbitrary manipulation of file names, it loses the context
SCons
would have in the Node, so if the returned strings are passed to a different
SConscript
file, any Node translation there will be relative to that
SConscript
directory, not to the original
SConscript
directory\&.)
.sp
The optional
\fIexclude\fR
argument may be set to a pattern or a list of patterns describing files or directories to filter out of the match list\&. Elements matching a least one specified pattern will be excluded\&. These patterns use the same syntax as for
\fIpattern\fR\&.

Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
Program("foo", Glob("*\&.c"))
Zip("/tmp/everything", Glob("\&.??*") + Glob("*"))

.sp
On the first call to
\fBHelp\fR, if
\fIappend\fR

calls\&. This is the help printed if
\fBHelp\fR

\fItext\fR
is appended to the existing help text\&. If
\fIlocal_only\fR

\fBTrue\fR
(the default is
\fBFalse\fR), the project\-local help from
\fBAddOption\fR
calls is preserved in the help message but the
\fBscons\fR

If
unique

If the first character in any string is an exclamation mark (!), the rest of the string is executed as a command, and the output from the command is parsed as GCC tool chain command\-line flags and added to the resulting dictionary\&. This can be used to call a

command typical of the POSIX programming environment (for example,
\fBpkg\-config\fR)\&. Note that such a command is executed using the SCons execution environment; if the command needs additional information, that information needs to be explicitly provided\&. See

\fBProgress\fR(\fIcallable, [interval]\fR), \fBProgress\fR(\fIstring, [interval, file, overwrite]\fR), \fBProgress\fR(\fIlist_of_strings, [interval, file, overwrite]\fR)
.RS 4
Allows SCons to show progress made during the build by displaying a string or calling a function while evaluating Nodes (e\&.g\&. files)\&.
.sp
If the first specified argument is a Python callable (a function or an object that has a
__call__
method), the function will be called once every
\fIinterval\fR
times a Node is evaluated (default
\fB1\fR)\&. The callable will be passed the evaluated Node as its only argument\&. (For future compatibility, it\*(Aqs a good idea to also add
\fI*args\fR
and
\fI**kwargs\fR
as arguments to your function or method signatures\&. This will prevent the code from breaking if
SCons
ever changes the interface to call the function with additional arguments in the future\&.)
.sp
An example of a simple custom progress function that prints a string containing the Node name every 10 Nodes:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def my_progress_function(node, *args, **kwargs):
    print(\*(AqEvaluating node %s!\*(Aq % node)
Progress(my_progress_function, interval=10)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
A more complicated example of a custom progress display object that prints a string containing a count every 100 evaluated Nodes\&. Note the use of
\er
(a carriage return) at the end so that the string will overwrite itself on a display:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import sys
class ProgressCounter(object):
    count = 0
    def __call__(self, node, *args, **kw):
        self\&.count += 100
        sys\&.stderr\&.write(\*(AqEvaluated %s nodes\er\*(Aq % self\&.count)

Progress(ProgressCounter(), interval=100)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the first argument to
\fBProgress\fR
is a string or list of strings, it is taken as text to be displayed every
\fIinterval\fR
evaluated Nodes\&. If the first argument is a list of strings, then each string in the list will be displayed in rotating fashion every
\fIinterval\fR
evaluated Nodes\&.
.sp
The default is to print the string on standard output\&. An alternate output stream may be specified with the
\fIfile\fR
keyword argument, which the caller must pass already opened\&.
.sp
The following will print a series of dots on the error output, one dot for every 100 evaluated Nodes:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import sys
Progress(\*(Aq\&.\*(Aq, interval=100, file=sys\&.stderr)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the string contains the verbatim substring
$TARGET;, it will be replaced with the Node\&. Note that, for performance reasons, this is
\fInot\fR
a regular SCons variable substitution, so you can not use other variables or use curly braces\&. The following example will print the name of every evaluated Node, using a carriage return) (\er) to cause each line to overwritten by the next line, and the
\fIoverwrite\fR
keyword argument (default
False) to make sure the previously\-printed file name is overwritten with blank spaces:
.sp

Progress(\*(Aq$TARGET\er\*(Aq, overwrite=True)

SCons

.sp

\fBPseudo\fR
may be useful in conjuction with a builder call (such as
\fBCommand\fR) which does not create a physical target, and the behavior if the target accidentally existed would be incorrect\&. This is similar in concept to the GNU

SCons

In

Repositories can also contain derived files\&. An example might be an official source tree maintained by an integrator\&. If a repository contains derived files, they should be the result of building with
SCons, so a signature database (sconsign) is present in the repository, allowing better decisions on whether they are up\-to\-date or not\&.
.sp
Note that if an up\-to\-date derived file already exists in a repository,
\fBscons\fR

\fInot\fR
make a copy in the local directory tree\&. If you need a local copy to be made, use the

By default
\fBReturn\fR

.RS 4
Executes subsidiary SConscript (build configuration) file(s)\&. There are two ways to call the
\fBSConscript\fR
function\&.
.sp
The first calling style is to supply one or more SConscript file names as the first positional argument, which can be a string or a list of strings\&. If there is a second positional argument, it is treated as if the
\fIexports\fR
keyword argument had been given (see below)\&. Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
SConscript(\*(AqSConscript\*(Aq)  # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript(\*(Aqsrc/SConscript\*(Aq)  # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript([\*(Aqsrc/SConscript\*(Aq, \*(Aqdoc/SConscript\*(Aq])
SConscript(Split(\*(Aqsrc/SConscript doc/SConscript\*(Aq))
config = SConscript(\*(AqMyConfig\&.py\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The second calling style is to omit the positional argument naming the script and instead specify directory names using the
\fIdirs\fR
keyword argument\&. The value can be a string or list of strings\&. In this case,
\fBscons\fR
will execute a subsidiary configuration file named
SConscript
(by default) in each of the specified directories\&. You may specify a name other than
SConscript
by supplying an optional
\fIname\fR=\fIscriptname\fR
keyword argument\&. The first three examples below have the same effect as the first three examples above:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
SConscript(dirs=\*(Aq\&.\*(Aq)  # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript(dirs=\*(Aqsrc\*(Aq)  # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript(dirs=[\*(Aqsrc\*(Aq, \*(Aqdoc\*(Aq])
SConscript(dirs=[\*(Aqsub1\*(Aq, \*(Aqsub2\*(Aq], name=\*(AqMySConscript\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The optional
\fIexports\fR
keyword argument specifies variables to make available for use by the called SConscripts, which are evaluated in an isolated context and otherwise do not have access to local variables from the calling SConscript\&. The value may be a string or list of strings representing variable names, or a dictionary mapping local names to the names they can be imported by\&. For the first (scriptnames) calling style, a second positional argument will also be interpreted as
\fIexports\fR; the second (directory) calling style accepts no positional arguments and must use the keyword form\&. These variables are locally exported only to the called SConscript file(s), and take precedence over any same\-named variables in the global pool managed by the
\fBExport\fR
function\&.
The subsidiary SConscript files must use the
\fBImport\fR
function to import the variables into their local scope\&. Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
foo = SConscript(\*(Aqsub/SConscript\*(Aq, exports=\*(Aqenv\*(Aq)
SConscript(\*(Aqdir/SConscript\*(Aq, exports=[\*(Aqenv\*(Aq, \*(Aqvariable\*(Aq])
SConscript(dirs=\*(Aqsubdir\*(Aq, exports=\*(Aqenv variable\*(Aq)

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.sp
If the optional
\fIvariant_dir\fR
argument is present, it causes an effect equivalent to the
\fBVariantDir\fR
function, but in effect only within the scope of the
\fBSConscript\fR
call\&. The
\fIvariant_dir\fR
argument is interpreted relative to the directory of the
\fIcalling\fR
SConscript file\&. The source directory is the directory in which the
\fIcalled\fR
SConscript file resides and the SConscript file is evaluated as if it were in the
\fIvariant_dir\fR
directory\&. Thus:
.sp
.if n \{\

.\}
.nf
SConscript(\*(Aqsrc/SConscript\*(Aq, variant_dir=\*(Aqbuild\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\

.if n \{\

The optional
\fIduplicate\fR

By default,

.RS 4
Specify where to store the
SCons
file signature database, and which database format to use\&. This may be useful to specify alternate database files and/or file locations for different types of builds\&.
.sp
The optional
\fIname\fR
argument is the base name of the database file(s)\&. If not an absolute path name, these are placed relative to the directory containing the top\-level
SConstruct
file\&. The default is
\&.sconsign\&. The actual database file(s) stored on disk may have an appropriate suffix appended by the chosen
\fIdbm_module\fR
.sp
The optional
\fIdbm_module\fR
argument specifies which
Python
database module to use for reading/writing the file\&. The module must be imported first; then the imported module name is passed as the argument\&. The default is a custom
SCons\&.dblite
module that uses pickled
Python
data structures, which works on all
Python
versions\&. See documentation of the
Python
dbm
module for other available types\&.
.sp
If called with no arguments, the database will default to
\&.sconsign\&.dblite
in the top directory of the project, which is also the default if if
\fBSConsignFile\fR
is not called\&.
.sp
The setting is global, so the only difference between the global function and the environment method form is variable expansion on
\fIname\fR\&. There should only be one active call to this function/method in a given build setup\&.
.sp
If
\fIname\fR
is set to
\fBNone\fR,
\fBscons\fR
will store file signatures in a separate
\&.sconsign
file in each directory, not in a single combined database file\&. This is a backwards\-compatibility measure to support what was the default behavior prior to
SCons
0\&.97 (i\&.e\&. before 2008)\&. Use of this mode is discouraged and may be deprecated in a future

\fBSideEffect\fR(\fIside_effect, target\fR), \fIenv\fR\&.SideEffect(\fIside_effect, target\fR)
.RS 4
Declares
\fIside_effect\fR
as a side effect of building
\fItarget\fR\&. Both
\fIside_effect\fR
and
\fItarget\fR
can be a list, a file name, or a node\&. A side effect is a target file that is created or updated as a side effect of building other targets\&. For example, a Windows PDB file is created as a side effect of building the \&.obj files for a static library, and various log files are created updated as side effects of various TeX commands\&. If a target is a side effect of multiple build commands,
\fBscons\fR
will ensure that only one set of commands is executed at a time\&. Consequently, you only need to use this method for side\-effect targets that are built as a result of multiple build commands\&.
.sp
Because multiple build commands may update the same side effect file, by default the
\fIside_effect\fR
target is
\fInot\fR
automatically removed when the
\fItarget\fR
is removed by the
\fB\-c\fR
option\&. (Note, however, that the
\fIside_effect\fR
might be removed as part of cleaning the directory in which it lives\&.) If you want to make sure the
\fIside_effect\fR
is cleaned whenever a specific
\fItarget\fR
is cleaned, you must specify this explicitly with the
\fBClean\fR
or
\fBenv\&.Clean\fR

\fIarg\fR
is a list or tuple returns the list or tuple unchanged\&. If
\fIarg\fR
is any other type of object, returns a list containing just the object\&. These non\-string cases do not actually do any spliting, but allow an argument variable to be passed to
\fBSplit\fR

.RS 4
Performs

interpolation (substitution) on

${\fIexpression\fR}, although if there is no ambiguity in recognizing the element, the braces can be omitted\&. A literal
\fB$\fR
can be entered by using
\fB$$\fR\&.
.sp
By default, leading or trailing white space will be removed from the result, and all sequences of white space will be compressed to a single space character\&. Additionally, any
$(
and
$)
character sequences will be stripped from the returned string, The optional
\fIraw\fR
argument may be set to
1
if you want to preserve white space and
$(\-$)
sequences\&. The
\fIraw\fR
argument may be set to
2
if you want to additionally discard all characters between any
$(

pairs (as is done for signature calculation)\&.
.sp
If
\fIinput\fR
is a sequence (list or tuple), the individual elements of the sequence will be expanded, and the results will be returned as a list\&.
.sp
The optional
\fItarget\fR

\fIsource\fR
keyword arguments must be set to lists of target and source nodes, respectively, if you want the
\fB$TARGET\fR,
\fB$TARGETS\fR,
\fB$SOURCE\fR

\fB$SOURCES\fR
to be available for expansion\&. This is usually necessary if you are calling
\fBenv\&.subst\fR
from within a
Python
function used as an SCons action\&.
.sp
Returned string values or sequence elements are converted to their string representation by default\&. The optional
\fIconv\fR
argument may specify a conversion function that will be used in place of the default\&. For example, if you want
Python
objects (including SCons Nodes) to be returned as
Python
objects, you can use a
Python
lambda expression to pass in an unnamed function that simply returns its unconverted argument\&.

Locates the tool specification module
\fIname\fR

\fIenv\fR, and
\fIname\fR
is appended to the
\fB$TOOLS\fR
construction variable
in that environment\&. When the global function
\fBTool\fR
form is used, the tool object is constructed but not called, as it lacks the context of an environment to update, and the returned object needs to be used to arrange for the call\&.
.sp
The tool module is searched for in the tool search paths (see the

Any remaining keyword arguments are saved in the tool object, and will be passed to the tool module\*(Aqs
\fBgenerate\fR

\fBValidateOptions\fR(\fI[throw_exception=False]\fR)
.RS 4
Check that all the options specified on the command line are either
SCons
built\-in options or defined via calls to
\fBAddOption\fR\&.
SCons
will eventually fail on unknown options anyway, but calling this function allows the build to "fail fast" before executing expensive logic later in the build\&.
.sp
This function should only be called after the last
\fBAddOption\fR
call in your
SConscript
logic\&. Be aware that some tools call
\fBAddOption\fR, if you are getting error messages for arguments that they add, you will need to ensure that those tools are loaded before calling
\fBValidateOptions\fR\&.
.sp
If there are any unknown command line options,
\fBValidateOptions\fR
prints an error message and exits with an error exit status\&. If the optional
\fIthrow_exception\fR
argument is
True
(default is
False), a
SConsBadOptionError
is raised, giving an opportunity for the
SConscript
logic to catch that exception and handle invalid options appropriately\&. Note that this exception name needs to be imported (see the example below)\&.
.sp
A common build problem is typos (or thinkos) \- a user enters an option that is just a little off the expected value, or perhaps a different word with a similar meaning\&. It may be useful to abort the build before going too far down the wrong path\&. For example:
.sp

Here
SCons
could go off and run a bunch of configure steps with the default value of
\-\-compiler, since the incorrect command line did not actually supply a value to it, costing developer time to track down why the configure logic made the "wrong" choices\&. This example shows catching this:

backfills as needed with files from
\fIsrc_dir\fR
to create a complete build directory\&. By default,
SCons
physically duplicates the source files, SConscript files, and directory structure as needed into the variant directory\&. Thus, a build performed in the variant directory is guaranteed to be identical to a build performed in the source directory even if intermediate source files are generated during the build, or if preprocessors or other scanners search for included files using paths relative to the source file, or if individual compilers or other invoked tools are hard\-coded to put derived files in the same directory as source files\&. Only the files
SCons
calculates are needed for the build are duplicated into
\fIvariant_dir\fR\&. If possible on the platform, the duplication is performed by linking rather than copying\&. This behavior is affected by the
\fB\-\-duplicate\fR
command\-line option\&.
.sp
Duplicating the source files may be disabled by setting the
\fIduplicate\fR
argument to
\fBFalse\fR\&. This will cause
SCons
to invoke Builders using the path names of source files in
\fIsrc_dir\fR
and the path names of derived files within
\fIvariant_dir\fR\&. This is more efficient than duplicating, and is safe for most builds; revert to
duplicate=True
if it causes problems\&.
.sp

\fBVariantDir\fR
works most naturally when used with a subsidiary SConscript file\&. The subsidiary SConscript file must be called as if it were in
\fIvariant_dir\fR, regardless of the value of
\fIduplicate\fR\&. When calling an SConscript file, you can use the
\fIexports\fR
keyword argument to pass parameters (individually or as an appropriately set up environment) so the SConscript can pick up the right settings for that variant build\&. The SConscript must
\fBImport\fR
these to use them\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env1 = Environment(\&.\&.\&.settings for variant1\&.\&.\&.)
env2 = Environment(\&.\&.\&.settings for variant2\&.\&.\&.)

.SS "Construction Variables"
.PP

Construction Variables
are key\-value pairs used to store information in a
construction environment
that is needed needed for builds using that environment\&.
Construction variable
naming must follow the same rules as
Python
identifier naming: the initial character must be an underscore or letter, followed by any number of underscores, letters, or digits\&. The convention is to use uppercase for all letters for easier visual identification\&.
.PP

Construction variables
are used to hold many different types of information\&. For example, the
\fB$CPPDEFINES\fR
variable is how to tell a C/C++ compiler about preprocessor macros you need for your build\&. The tool discovery that
SCons
performs will cause the
\fB$CXX\fR
variable to hold the name of the C++ compiler, if one was detected on the system, but you can give it a different value to force a compiler command of a different name to be used\&. Some variables contain lists of filename suffixes that are recognized by a particular compiler chain\&.
\fB$BUILDERS\fR
contains a mapping of configured Builder names (e\&.g\&.
\fBTextfile\fR) to the actual Builder instance to call when that Builder is used\&.
Construction variables
may include references to other
construction variables: the same tool which set up the C/C++ compiler will also set up an "action string", describing how to invoke that compiler, in
\fB$CXXCOM\fR, which contains other
construction variables
using
$VARIABLE
syntax\&. These references will be expanded and replaced on use (see
Variable Substitution)\&.
.PP

Construction variables
are referenced as if they were keys and values in a
Python
dictionary:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env["CC"] = "cc"
flags = env\&.get("CPPDEFINES", [])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Construction variables
can also be retrieved and set by using the
\fBDictionary\fR
method of the
construction environment
to create an actual dictionary:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
cvars = env\&.Dictionary()
cvars["CC"] = "cc"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
in the previous example, since
\fIcvars\fR
is an external copy, the value of
\fB$CC\fR
in the
construction environment
itself is not changed by the assignment\&.
.PP
Construction variables
can set by passing them as keyword arguments when creating a new
construction environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(CC="cc")
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
or when copying a
construction environment
using the
\fBClone\fR
method:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env2 = env\&.Clone(CC="cl\&.exe")
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP

Construction variables
can also be supplied as keyword arguments to a builder, in which case those settings affect only the work done by that builder call, and not the
construction environment
as a whole\&. This concept is called an
override:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.Program(\*(Aqhello\*(Aq, \*(Aqhello\&.c\*(Aq, LIBS=[\*(Aqgl\*(Aq, \*(Aqglut\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Many useful
construction variables
are automatically defined by
SCons, tuned to the specific platform in use, and you can modify these or define any additional
construction variables
for use in your own Builders, Scanners and other tools\&. Take care not to overwrite ones which
SCons
is using\&. The following is a list of predefined
construction variables\&. Pay attention to whether the values are ones you may be expected to set vs\&. ones that are set to expected values by internal tools and other initializations and probably should not be modified\&.
.PP
Note the actual list available at execution time will never include all of these, as the ones detected as not being applicable (wrong platform, necessary external command or files not installed, etc\&.) will not be set up\&. Correct build setups should be resilient to the possible absence of certain
construction variables
before using them, for example by using a
Python
dictionary
\fBget\fR
method to retrieve the value and taking alternative action if the return indicates the variable is unset\&. The
\fBenv\&.Dump\fR

set in a particular environment\&.

For portability, a string\-valued library name should include only the base library name, without prefixes such as

\&.dll\&.
SCons
\fIwill\fR
attempt to strip prefixes from the

list, but depending on that behavior will make the build less portable: for example, on a POSIX system, no attempt will be made to strip a suffix like
\&.dll\&. Library name strings in
\fB$LIBS\fR
should not include a path component: instead use
\fB$LIBPATH\fR
to direct the compiler to look for libraries in those paths, plus any default paths the linker searches in\&. If
\fB$LIBLITERALPREFIX\fR
is set to a non\-empty string, then a string\-valued
\fB$LIBS\fR
entry that starts with
\fB$LIBLITERALPREFIX\fR

.sp
If a
\fB$LIBS\fR
entry is a Node object (either as returned by a previous Builder call, or as the result of an explicit call to

The

On the
win32
platform, if the
Microsoft Visual C++
compiler is available,
msvc
tool setup is done using
\fB$HOST_ARCH\fR
and
\fB$TARGET_ARCH\fR\&. If a value is not specified, will be set to the same value as
\fB$HOST_ARCH\fR\&. Changing the value after the environment is initialized will not cause the tool to be reinitialized\&. Compiled objects will be in the target architecture if the compilation system supports generating for that target\&. The latest compiler which can fulfill the requirement will be selected, unless a different version is directed by the value of the
\fB$MSVC_VERSION\fR
construction variable\&.
.sp
On the win32/msvc combination, valid target arch values are
x86,
arm,
i386
for 32\-bit targets and
amd64,
arm64,
x86_64
and
ia64
(Itanium) for 64\-bit targets\&. For example, if you want to compile 64\-bit binaries, you would set
TARGET_ARCH=\*(Aqx86_64\*(Aq
when creating the
construction environment\&. Note that not all target architectures are supported for all Visual Studio / MSVC versions\&. Check the relevant Microsoft documentation\&.

\fBTEMPFILE\fR
.RS 4
Holds a callable object which will be invoked to transform long command lines (string or list) into an alternate form\&. Length limits on various operating systems may cause long command lines to fail when calling out to a shell to run the command\&. Most often affects linking, when there are many object files and/or libraries to be linked, but may also affect other compilation steps which have many arguments\&.
\fB$TEMPFILE\fR
is not called directly, but rather is typically embedded in another
construction variable, to be expanded when used\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env["TEMPFILE"] = TempFileMunge
env["LINKCOM"] = "${TEMPFILE(\*(Aq$LINK $TARGET $SOURCES\*(Aq, \*(Aq$LINKCOMSTR\*(Aq)}"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The SCons default value for
\fB$TEMPFILE\fR,
TempFileMunge, performs command substitution on the passed command line, calculates whether modification is needed, then puts all but the first word (assumed to be the command name) of the resulting list into a temporary file (sometimes called a response file or command file), and returns a new command line consisting of the the command name and an appropriately formatted reference to the temporary file\&.
.sp
A replacement for the default tempfile object would need to do fundamentally the same thing, including taking into account the values of
\fB$MAXLINELENGTH\fR,
\fB$TEMPFILEPREFIX\fR,
\fB$TEMPFILESUFFIX\fR,
\fB$TEMPFILEARGJOIN\fR,
\fB$TEMPFILEDIR\fR
and
\fB$TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC\fR\&. If a particular use case requires a different transformation than the default, it is recommended to copy the mechanism and define a new
construction variable
and rewrite the relevant
*COM
variable(s) to use it, to avoid possibly disrupting existing uses of
\fB$TEMPFILE\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBTEMPFILEARGESCFUNC\fR
.RS 4
The default argument escape function is
\fBSCons\&.Subst\&.quote_spaces\fR\&. If you need to apply extra operations on a command argument (to fix Windows slashes, normalize paths, etc\&.) before writing to the temporary file, you can set the
\fB$TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC\fR
variable to a custom function\&. Such a function takes a single string argument and returns a new string with any modifications applied\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import sys
import re
from SCons\&.Subst import quote_spaces

WINPATHSEP_RE = re\&.compile(r"\e\e([^\e"\*(Aq\e\e]|$)")

You can define your own custom checks in addition to using the predefined checks\&. To enable custom checks, pass a dictionary to the

.SS "Command\-Line Construction Variables"
.PP

SCons
depends on information stored in
construction variables
to control how targets are built\&. It is often necessary to pass specialized information at build time to override the variables in the build scripts\&. This can be done through variable\-assignment arguments on the command line and/or in stored variable files\&.
.PP
For the case where you want to specify new values for
construction variables,
SCons
provides a
\fBVariables\fR
object to simplify collecting those and updating a
construction environment
with the values\&. This helps processing commands lines like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons VARIABLE=foo OTHERVAR=bar\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Variables supplied on the command line can always be manually processed by iterating the
\fIARGUMENTS\fR
dictionary or the
\fIARGLIST\fR
list, However, using a
\fBVariables\fR
object allows you to describe anticipated variables, perform necessary type conversion, validate that values meet defined constraints, and specify default values, help messages and aliases\&. This provides a somewhat similar interface to option handling (see
\fBAddOption\fR)\&. A
\fBVariables\fR
object also allows obtaining values from a saved variables file, or from a custom dictionary in an
SConscript
file\&. The processed variables can then be applied to the desired
construction environment\&.
.PP
Conceptually, command\-line targets control what to build, command\-line variables (and variable files) control how to build, and command\-line options control how
SCons
operates (although
SCons
does not enforce that separation)\&.
.PP
To obtain an object for manipulating variables, call the
\fBVariables\fR
factory function:
.PP
\fBVariables\fR([\fIfiles, [args]]\fR)
.RS 4
If
\fIfiles\fR
is a filename or list of filenames, they are executed as
Python
scripts to set saved variables when the
\fBUpdate\fR
method is called\&. This allows the use of
Python
syntax in the assignments\&. A variables file can be the result of an previous call to the
\fBSave\fR
method\&. If
\fIfiles\fR
is not specified, or the
\fIfiles\fR
argument is
\fBNone\fR, then no files will be processed\&. Supplying
\fBNone\fR
is required if there are no files but you want to specify
\fIargs\fR
as a positional argument; or you can use keyword arguments to avoid that\&. If any of
\fIfiles\fR
is missing, it is silently skipped\&.
.sp
Either of the following example file contents could be used to set an alternative C compiler:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
CC = \*(Aqmy_cc\*(Aq
CC = os\&.environ\&.get(\*(AqCC\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If
\fIargs\fR
is specified, it must be a dictionary\&. The key\-value pairs from
\fIargs\fR
will be added to those obtained from
\fIfiles\fR, if any\&. Keys from
\fIargs\fR
take precedence over same\-named keys from
\fIfiles\fR\&. If omitted, the default is the
\fIARGUMENTS\fR
dictionary that holds build variables specified on the command line\&. Using
\fIARGUMENTS\fR
allows you to indicate that if a setting appears on both the command line and in the file(s), the command line setting is preferred\&. However, any dictionary can be passed\&. Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
vars = Variables(\*(Aqcustom\&.py\*(Aq)
vars = Variables(\*(Aqoverrides\&.py\*(Aq, ARGUMENTS)
vars = Variables(None, {FOO:\*(Aqexpansion\*(Aq, BAR:7})
vars = Variables(args={FOO:\*(Aqexpansion\*(Aq, BAR:7})
.fi

A
\fBVariables\fR
object is a container for variable descriptions, added by calling the
\fBAdd\fR
or
\fBAddVariables\fR
methods\&. A variable description consists of a name, a list of aliases for the name, a help message, a default value, and functions to validate and convert values\&. Processing of input sources is deferred until the
\fBUpdate\fR
method is called, at which time the variables are added to the specified
construction environment, using the name as the
construction variable
name; any aliases are not added\&. Variables from the input sources which do not match any names or aliases from the variable descriptions in this object are skipped, except that a dictionary of their names and values are made available in the
\fIunknown\fR
attribute of the
\fBVariables\fR
object\&. This list can also be obtained via the
\fBUnknownVariables\fR
method\&. If a variable description has a default value other than
None
and does not appear in the input sources, it is added to the
construction environment
with its default value\&. A list of variables set from their defaults and not from the input sources is available as the
\fIdefaulted\fR
attribute of the
\fBVariables\fR
object\&. The unknown variables and defaulted information is not available until the
\fBUpdate\fR
method has run\&.
.PP
Since the variables are eventually added as
construction variables, you should choose variable names which do not unintentionally change pre\-defined
construction variables
that your project will make use of (see
the section called \(lqConstruction Variables\(rq
for a reference), since the specified values are assigned, not merged, to the respective
construction variables\&.
.PP
The
\fBVariables\fR
subsystem does not directly support a way to define a variable the user
\fImust\fR
supply, but this can be simulated by using a validator function, and specifying a default value which the validator will reject, resulting in an invalid value error message (the convenience methods
\fBEnumVariable\fR
and
\fBListVariable\fR
make this relatively straightforward)\&.
.PP
A
\fBVariables\fR
object has the following methods:
.PP
\fIvars\fR\&.\fBAdd\fR(\fIkey, [help, default, validator, converter, subst]\fR)
.RS 4
Add a customizable
construction variable
to the
\fBVariables\fR
object\&.
\fIkey\fR
is either the name of the variable, or a sequence of strings, in which case the first item in the sequence is taken as the variable name, and any remaining values are considered aliases for the variable\&.
\fIkey\fR
is mandatory, the other fields are optional\&.
\fIhelp\fR
is the help text for the variable (defaults to an empty string)\&.
\fIdefault\fR
is the default value of the variable (defaults to
\fBNone\fR)\&. The variable will be set to the value of
\fIdefault\fR
if it does not appear in the input sources, except if
\fIdefault\fR
is
None, in which case it is not added to the
construction environment
unless it has been set in the input sources\&.
.sp
If the
\fIvalidator\fR
argument is supplied, it is a callback function to validate the value of the variable when the variables are processed (that is, when the
\fBUpdate\fR
method runs)\&. A validator function must accept three arguments:
\fIkey\fR,
\fIvalue\fR
and
\fIenv\fR, and should raise an exception (with a helpful error message) if
\fIvalue\fR
is invalid\&. No return value is expected from the validator\&.
.sp
If the
\fIconverter\fR
argument is supplied, it is a callback function to convert the value into one suitable for adding to the
construction environment\&. A converter function must accept the
\fIvalue\fR
argument, and may declare
\fIenv\fR
as a second argument if it needs access to the
construction environment
while validating \- the function will be called appropriately\&. The converter is called before the validator; it must return a value, which is then passed to the
\fIvalidator\fR
(if any) for checking\&. In general, the converter should not fail, leaving validation checks to the validator, although if an operation is impossible to complete or there is no separate validator it can raise a
ValueError\&.
.sp
Substitution will be performed on the variable value before the converter and validator are called, unless the optional
\fIsubst\fR
parameter is false (the default is
True)\&. Suppressing substitution may be useful if the variable value looks like a
construction variable
reference (e\&.g\&.
$VAR) and the validator and/or converter should see it unexpanded\&.
.sp
As a special case, if
\fIkey\fR
is a sequence and is the
\fIonly\fR
argument to
\fBAdd\fR, it is unpacked into the five parameters
\fIkey\fR,
\fIhelp\fR,
\fIdefault\fR,
\fIvalidator\fR
and
\fIconverter\fR, with any missing members from the right filled in with the respective default values\&. This form allows it to consume a tuple emitted by the convenience functions

Filesystem Nodes
represent build components that correspond to an entry in the computer\*(Aqs filesystem, whether or not such an entry exists at the time the Node is created\&. You do not usually need to explicitly create filesystem Nodes, since when you supply a string as a target or source of a Builder,
SCons

\fBValue and Alias Nodes\fR
.RS 4
.PP

SCons
provides two other Node types to represent object that will not have an equivalent filesystem entry\&. Such Nodes always need to be created explicitly\&.
.PP
The
\fBAlias\fR
method returns an Alias Node\&. Aliases are virtual objects \- they will not themselves result in physical objects being constructed, but are entered into the dependency graph related to their sources\&. An alias is checked for up to date by checking if its sources are up\-to\-date\&. An alias is built by making sure its sources have been built, and if any building took place, applying any Actions that are defined as part of the alias\&.
.PP
An
\fBAlias\fR
call creates an entry in the alias namespace, which is used for disambiguation\&. If an alias source has a string valued name, it will be resolved to a filesystem entry Node, unless it is found in the alias namespace, in which case it is resolved to the matching alias Node\&. As a result, the order of
\fBAlias\fR
calls is significant\&. An alias can refer to another alias, but only if the other alias has previously been created\&.
.PP
The
\fBValue\fR
method returns a Value Node\&. Value nodes are often used for generated data that will not have any corresponding filesystem entry, but will be used to determine whether a build target is out\-of\-date, or to include as part of a build Action\&. Common examples are timestamp strings, revision control version strings and other run\-time generated strings\&.
.PP
A Value Node can also be the target of a builder\&.
.RE
.SH "EXTENDING SCONS"
.PP

SCons
is designed to be extensible through provided facilities, so changing the code of
SCons
itself is only rarely needed to customize its behavior\&. A number of the main operations use callable objects which can be supplemented by writing your own\&. Builders, Scanners and Tools each use a kind of plugin system, allowing you to easily drop in new ones\&. Information about creating
Builder Objects
and
Scanner Objects
appear in the following sections\&. The instructions
SCons
actually uses to construct things are called Actions, and it is easy to create Action Objects and hand them to the objects that need to know about those actions (besides Builders, see
\fBAddPostAction\fR,
\fBAddPreAction\fR
and
\fBAlias\fR
for some examples of other places that take Actions)\&.
Action Objects
are also described below\&. Adding new Tool modules is described in
Tool Modules
.SS "Builder Objects"
.PP
\fBscons\fR
can be extended to build different types of targets by adding new Builder objects to a
construction environment\&.
\fIIn general\fR, you should only need to add a new Builder object when you want to build a new type of file or other external target\&. For output file types
\fBscons\fR
already knows about, you can usually modify the behavior of premade Builders such as
\fBProgram\fR,
\fBObject\fR
or
\fBLibrary\fR
by changing the
construction variables
they use (\fB$CC\fR,
\fB$LINK\fR, etc\&.)\&. In this manner you can, for example, change the compiler to use, which is simpler and less error\-prone than writing a new builder\&. The documentation for each Builder lists which
construction variables
it uses\&.
.PP
Builder objects are created using the
\fBBuilder\fR
factory function\&. Once created, a builder is added to an environment by entering it in the
\fB$BUILDERS\fR
dictionary in that environment (some of the examples in this section illustrate this)\&. Doing so automatically triggers
SCons
to add a method with the name of the builder to the environment\&.
.PP
The
\fBBuilder\fR
function accepts the following keyword arguments:
.PP
\fIaction\fR
.RS 4
The command used to build the target from the source\&.
\fIaction\fR
may be a string representing a template command line to execute, a list of strings representing the command to execute with its arguments (suitable for enclosing white space in an argument), a dictionary mapping source file name suffixes to any combination of command line strings (if the builder should accept multiple source file extensions), a
Python
function, an Action object (see
Action Objects) or a list of any of the above\&.

An action function must accept three arguments:
\fIsource\fR,
\fItarget\fR

\fItarget\fR

A function passed as

\fIfor_signature\fR\&.
\fIsource\fR

\fItarget\fR

\fIenv\fR

\fIfor_signature\fR

The

\fBBuilder\fR, or other functions that take actions as arguments, by calling the
\fBAction\fR
factory function\&. This may more efficient when multiple Builder objects need to do the same thing rather than letting each of those Builder objects create a separate Action object\&. It also allows more flexible configuration of an Action object\&. For example, to control the message printed when the action is taken you need to create the action object using
\fBAction\fR\&.

If provided, indicates that the Action can create multiple target files by processing multiple independent source files simultaneously\&. (The canonical example is "batch compilation" of multiple object files by passing multiple source files to a single invocation of a compiler such as
Microsoft Visual C++\&. If the
\fIbatch_key\fR
argument evaluates True and is not a callable object, the configured Action object will cause
\fBscons\fR
to collect all targets built with the Action object and configured with the same
construction environment
into single invocations of the Action object\*(Aqs command line or function\&. Command lines will typically want to use the
\fB$CHANGED_SOURCES\fR
construction variable

\fB$CHANGED_TARGETS\fR

The
\fIbatch_key\fR
argument may also be a callable function that returns a key that will be used to identify different "batches" of target files to be collected for batch building\&. A
\fIbatch_key\fR
function must accept four parameters:
\fIaction\fR,
\fIenv\fR,
\fItarget\fR
and
\fIsource\fR\&. The first parameter,
\fIaction\fR, is the active action object\&. The second parameter,
\fIenv\fR, is the
construction environment
configured for the target\&. The
\fItarget\fR
and
\fIsource\fR
parameters are the lists of targets and sources for the configured action\&.
.sp
The returned key should typically be a tuple of values derived from the arguments, using any appropriate logic to decide how multiple invocations should be batched\&. For example, a
\fIbatch_key\fR
function may decide to return the value of a specific
construction variable
from
\fIenv\fR
which will cause
\fBscons\fR
to batch\-build targets with matching values of that
construction variable, or perhaps return the
Python
\fBid\fR() of the entire
construction environment, in which case
\fBscons\fR
will batch\-build all targets configured with the same
construction environment\&. Returning
\fBNone\fR
indicates that the particular target should
\fInot\fR
be part of any batched build, but instead will be built by a separate invocation of action\*(Aqs command or function\&. Example:

\fBVariable Substitution\fR
.RS 4
.PP
Before executing a command,
\fBscons\fR
performs parameter expansion (substitution) on the string that makes up the action part of the builder\&. The format of a substitutable parameter is
${\fIexpression\fR}\&. If
\fIexpression\fR
refers to a variable, the braces in
${\fIexpression\fR}
can be omitted
\fIunless\fR
the variable name is immediately followed by a character that could either be interpreted as part of the name, or is
Python
syntax such as
\fB[\fR
(for indexing/slicing) or
\fB\&.\fR
(for attribute access \- see
Special Attributes
below)\&.
.PP
If
\fIexpression\fR
refers to a
construction variable, it (including the
$
or
${ }) is replaced with the value of that variable in the
construction environment
at the time of execution\&. If
\fIexpression\fR
looks like a variable name but is not defined in the
construction environment
it is replaced with an empty string\&. If
\fIexpression\fR
refers to one of the
Special Variables
(see below) the corresponding value of the variable is substituted\&.
\fIexpression\fR
may also be a
Python
expression to be evaluated\&. See
Python Code Substitution
below for a description\&.
.PP
SCons
uses the following rules when converting
construction variables
into command line strings:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If the value is a string it is interpreted as space delimited command line arguments\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

If the value is a list it is interpreted as a list of command line arguments\&. Each element of the list is converted to a string\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

Anything that is not a list or string is converted to a string and interpreted as a single command line argument\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Newline characters (\en) delimit lines\&. The newline parsing is done after all other parsing, so it is not possible for arguments (e\&.g\&. file names) to contain embedded newline characters\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

For a literal
\fB$\fR
use
\fB$$\fR\&. For example,
$$FOO
will be left in the final string as
$FOO\&.
.RE
.PP
When a build action is executed, a hash of the command line is saved, together with other information about the target(s) built by the action, for future use in rebuild determination\&. This is called the
build signature
(or
build action signature)\&. The escape sequence
\fB$(\fR
\fIsubexpression\fR
\fB$)\fR
may be used to indicate parts of a command line that may change without causing a rebuild\-\-that is, which are not to be included when calculating the
build signature\&. All text from
\fB$(\fR
up to and including the matching
\fB$)\fR
will be removed from the command line before it is added to the
build signature
while only the
\fB$(\fR
and
\fB$)\fR
will be removed before the command is executed\&. For example, the command line string:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
"echo Last build occurred $( $TODAY $)\&. > $TARGET"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
would execute the command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
echo Last build occurred $TODAY\&. > $TARGET
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
but the
build signature
added to any target files would be computed from:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
echo Last build occurred  \&. > $TARGET
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
While
construction variables
are normally directly substituted, if a
construction variable
has a value which is a callable
Python
object (a function, or a class with a
__call__
method), that object is called during substitution\&. The callable must accept four arguments:
\fItarget\fR,
\fIsource\fR,
\fIenv\fR
and
\fIfor_signature\fR\&.
\fIsource\fR
is a list of source nodes,
\fItarget\fR
is a list of target nodes,
\fIenv\fR
is the
construction environment
to use for context, and
\fIfor_signature\fR
is a boolean value that tells the callable if it is being called for the purpose of generating a
build signature\&. Since the
build signature
is used for rebuild determination, variable elements that do not affect whether a rebuild should be triggered should be omitted from the returned string if
\fIfor_signature\fR
is true\&. See
\fB$(\fR
and
\fB$)\fR
above for the syntax\&.
.PP

SCons
will insert whatever the callable returns into the expanded string:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def foo(target, source, env, for_signature):
    return "bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "bar baz"
env = Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="$FOO baz")
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
As a reminder, substitution happens when
$BAR
is actually used in a builder action\&. The value of
env[\*(AqBAR\*(Aq]
will be exactly as it was set:
"$FOO baz"\&. This can make debugging tricky, as the substituted result is not available at the time the
SConscript
files are being interpreted and thus not available to the
print
function\&. However, you can perform the substitution on demand by calling the
\fBenv\&.subst\fR
method for this purpose\&.
.PP
You can use this feature to pass arguments to a callable variable by creating a callable class that stores passed arguments in the instance, and then uses them (in the
__call__
method) when the instance is called\&. Note that in this case, the entire variable expansion must be enclosed by curly braces so that the arguments will be associated with the instantiation of the class:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
class foo:
    def __init__(self, arg):
        self\&.arg = arg

    def __call__(self, target, source, env, for_signature):

.SS "Scanner Objects"
.PP
Scanner objects are used to scan specific file types for implicit dependencies, for example embedded preprocessor/compiler directives that cause other files to be included during processing\&.
SCons
has a number of pre\-built Scanner objects, so it is usually only necessary to set up Scanners for new file types\&. You do this by calling the
\fBScanner\fR
factory function\&.
\fBScanner\fR
accepts the following arguments\&. Only
\fIfunction\fR
is required; the rest are optional:
.PP
\fIfunction\fR
.RS 4
A function which can process ("scan") a given Node (usually a file) and return a list of Nodes representing any implicit dependencies (usually files) which will be tracked for the Node\&. The function must accept three required arguments,
\fInode\fR,
\fIenv\fR
and
\fIpath\fR, and an optional fourth,
\fIarg\fR\&.
\fInode\fR
is the internal
SCons
node representing the file to scan,
\fIenv\fR
is the
construction environment
to use during the scan, and
\fIpath\fR
is a tuple of directories that can be searched for files, as generated by the optional scanner
\fIpath_function\fR\&. If the
\fIargument\fR
parameter was supplied when the Scanner object was created, it is passed as the
\fIarg\fR
parameter to the scanner function when it is called\&. Since
\fIargument\fR
is optional, the scanner function
\fImay\fR
be called without an
\fIarg\fR
parameter\&.
.sp
The scanner function can make use of
\fBstr\fR(\fInode\fR) to fetch the name of the file,
\fInode\fR\&.dir
to fetch the directory the file is in,
\fInode\fR\&.get_contents() to fetch the contents of the file as bytes or
\fInode\fR\&.get_text_contents() to fetch the contents of the file as text\&.
.sp
The scanner function should account for any directories listed in the
\fIpath\fR
parameter when determining the existence of possible dependencies\&. External tools such as the C/C++ preprocessor are given lists of directories to search for source file inclusion directives (e\&.g\&.
#include "myheader\&.h")\&. That list is generated from the relevant path variable (e\&.g\&.
\fB$CPPPATH\fR
for C/C++)\&. The Scanner can be directed to pass the same list on to the scanner function via the
\fIpath\fR
parameter so it can search in the same places\&. The Scanner is enabled to pass this list via the
\fIpath_function\fR
argument at Scanner creation time\&.
.sp
Instead of a scanner function, you can supply a dictionary as the
\fIfunction\fR
parameter\&. The dictionary must map keys (such as file suffixes) to other Scanner objects\&. A Scanner created this way serves as a dispatcher: the Scanner\*(Aqs
\fIskeys\fR
parameter is automatically populated with the dictionary\*(Aqs keys, indicating that the Scanner handles Nodes which would be selected by those keys; the mapping is then used to pass the file on to a different Scanner that would not have been selected to handle that Node based on its own
\fIskeys\fR\&.
.sp
Note that the file to scan is
\fInot\fR
guaranteed to exist at the time the scanner is called \- it could be a generated file which has not been generated yet \- so the scanner function must be tolerant of that\&.
.sp
While many scanner functions operate on source code files by looking for known patterns in the code, they can really do anything they need to\&. For example, the
\fBProgram\fR
Builder is assigned a
\fItarget_scanner\fR
which examines the list of libraries supplied for the build (\fB$LIBS\fR) and decides whether to add them as dependencies, it does not look
\fIinside\fR
the built binary\&.
.sp
It is up to the scanner function to decide whether or not to generate an
SCons
dependency for candidates identified by scanning\&. Dependencies are a key part of
SCons
operation, enabling both rebuild determination and correct ordering of builds\&. It is particularly important that generated files which are dependencies are added into the Node graph, or use\-before\-create failures are likely\&. However, not everything may need to be tracked as a dependency\&. In some cases, implementation\-provided header files change infrequently but are included very widely, so tracking them in the
SCons
node graph could become quite expensive for limited benefit \- consider for example the C standard header file
string\&.h\&. The scanner function is not passed any special information to help make this choice, so the decision\-making encoded in the scanner function must be carefully considered\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIname\fR

"NONE"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIargument\fR

\fIfunction\fR

.RE
.PP
\fIskeys\fR
.RS 4
Scanner key(s) indicating the file types this scanner is associated with\&. Used internally to select an appropriate scanner\&. In the usual case of scanning for file names, this argument will be a list of suffixes for the different file types that this Scanner knows how to scan\&. If
\fIskeys\fR
is a string, it will be expanded into a list by the current environment\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIpath_function\fR
.RS 4
If specified, a function to generate paths to pass to the scanner function to search while generating dependencies\&. The function must take five arguments: a
construction environment, a Node for the directory containing the
SConscript
file in which the first target was defined, a list of target nodes, a list of source nodes, and the value of
\fIargument\fR
if it was supplied when the Scanner was created (since
\fIargument\fR
is optional, the function may be called without this argument, the
\fIpath_function\fR
should be prepared for this)\&. Must return a tuple of directories that can be searched for files to be returned by this Scanner object\&.
.sp
The
\fBFindPathDirs\fR
function can be called to return a ready\-made
\fIpath_function\fR
for a given
construction variable
name, which is often easier than writing your own function from scratch\&. For example,
\fBpath_function=FindPathDirs(\*(AqCPPPATH\*(Aq)\fR

Once created, a Scanner can be added to an environment by setting it in the

SCons

SCons
has a global
SourceFileScanner
object that is used by the

A tool specification module is a form of

.SH "SYSTEM-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR"
.PP
\fBscons\fR
and its configuration files are very portable, due largely to its implementation in
Python\&. There are, however, a few portability issues waiting to trap the unwary\&.
.SS "\&.C File Suffix"
.PP
\fBscons\fR
handles the upper\-case
\&.C
file suffix differently, depending on the capabilities of the underlying system\&. On a case\-sensitive system such as Linux or UNIX,
\fBscons\fR
treats a file with a
\&.C
suffix as a C++ source file\&. On a case\-insensitive system such as Windows,
\fBscons\fR
treats a file with a
\&.C
suffix as a C source file\&.
.SS "Fortran File Suffixes"
.PP
There are several ways source file suffixes impact the behavior of
SCons
when working with Fortran language code (not all are system\-specific, but they are included here for completeness)\&.
.PP
As the Fortran language has evolved through multiple standards editions, projects might have a need to handle files from different language generations differently\&. To this end,
SCons
dispatches to a different compiler dialect setup (expressed as a set of
construction variables) depending on the file suffix\&. By default, all of these setups start out the same, but individual
construction variables
can be modified as needed to tune a given dialect\&. Each of these dialects has a tool specification module whose documentation describes the
construction variables
associated with that dialect:
\&.f
(as well as
\&.for
and
\&.ftn) in
fortran; (construction variables
start with
FORTRAN)
\&.f77
in
f77; (construction variables
start with
F77)
\&.f90
in
f90; (construction variables
start with
F90)
\&.f95
in
f95; (construction variables
start with
F95)
\&.f03
in
f03; (construction variables
start with
F03)
\&.f08
in
f08
(construction variables
start with
F08)\&.
.PP
While
SCons
recognizes multiple internal dialects based on filename suffixes, the convention of various available Fortran compilers is to assign an actual meaning to only two of these suffixes:
\&.f
(as well as
\&.for
and
\&.ftn) refers to the fixed\-format source code that was the only available option in FORTRAN 77 and earlier, and
\&.f90
refers to free\-format source code which became available as of the Fortran 90 standard\&. Some compilers recognize suffixes which correspond to Fortran specifications later than F90 as equivalent to
\&.f90
for this purpose, while some do not \- check the documentation for your compiler\&. An occasionally suggested policy suggestion is to use only
\&.f
and
\&.f90
as Fortran filename suffixes\&. The fixed/free form determination can usually be controlled explicitly with compiler flags (e\&.g\&.
\fB\-ffixed\-form\fR
for gfortran), overriding any assumption that may be made based on the source file suffix\&.
.PP
The source file suffix does not imply conformance with the similarly\-named Fortran standard \- a suffix of
\&.f08
does not mean you are compiling specifically for Fortran 2008\&. Normally, compilers provide command\-line options for making this selection (e\&.g\&.
\fB\-std=f2008\fR
for gfortran)\&.
.PP
For dialects from F90 on (including the generic FORTRAN dialect), a suffix of
\&.mod
is recognized for Fortran modules\&. These files are a side effect of compiling a Fortran source file containing module declarations, and must be available when other code which declares that it uses the module is processed\&.
SCons
does not currently have integrated support for submodules, introduced in the Fortran 2008 standard \- the invoked compiler will produce results, but
SCons
will not recognize
\&.smod
files as tracked objects\&.
.PP
On a case\-sensitive system such as Linux or UNIX, a file with a an upper\-cased suffix from the set
\&.F,
\&.FOR,
\&.FTN,
\&.F90,
\&.F95,
\&.F03
and
\&.F08
is treated as a Fortran source file which shall first be run through the standard C preprocessor\&. The lower\-cased versions of these suffixes do not trigger this behavior\&. On systems which do not distinguish between upper and lower case in filenames, this behavior is not available, but files suffixed with either
\&.FPP
or
\&.fpp
are always passed to the preprocessor first\&. This matches the convention of
\fBgfortran\fR
from the GNU Compiler Collection, and also followed by certain other Fortran compilers\&. For these two suffixes, the generic
\fIFORTRAN\fR
dialect will be selected\&.
.PP

SCons
itself does not invoke the preprocessor, that is handled by the compiler, but it adds
construction variables
which are applicable to the preprocessor run\&. You can see this difference by examining
\fB$FORTRANPPCOM\fR
and
\fB$FORTRANPPCOMSTR\fR
which are used instead of
\fB$FORTRANCOM\fR
and
\fB$FORTRANCOMSTR\fR
for that dialect\&.
.SS "Windows: Cygwin Tools and Cygwin Python vs\&. Windows Pythons"
.PP
Cygwin supplies a set of tools and utilities that let users work on a Windows system using a POSIX\-like environment\&. The Cygwin tools, including Cygwin
Python, do this, in part, by sharing an ability to interpret POSIX\-style path names\&. For example, the Cygwin tools will internally translate a Cygwin path name like
/cygdrive/c/mydir
to an equivalent Windows pathname of
C:/mydir
(equivalent to
C:\emydir)\&.
.PP
Versions of
Python
that are built for native Windows execution, such as the python\&.org and ActiveState versions, do not understand the Cygwin path name semantics\&. This means that using a native Windows version of
Python
to build compiled programs using Cygwin tools (such as
gcc,
bison
and
flex) may yield unpredictable results\&. "Mixing and matching" in this way can be made to work, but it requires careful attention to the use of path names in your
SConscript
files\&.
.PP
In practice, users can sidestep the issue by adopting the following guidelines: When using Cygwin\*(Aqs
gcc
for compiling, use the Cygwin\-supplied
Python
interpreter to run
\fBscons\fR; when using
Microsoft Visual C++
(or some other "native" Windows compiler) use the python\&.org, Microsoft Store, ActiveState or other native version of
Python
to run
\fBscons\fR\&.
.PP
This discussion largely applies to the msys2 environment as well (with the use of the mingw compiler toolchain), in particular the recommendation to use the msys2 version of
Python
if running
\fBscons\fR
from inside an msys2 shell\&.
.SS "Windows: scons\&.bat file"
.PP
On Windows, if
\fBscons\fR
is executed via a wrapper
scons\&.bat
batch file, there are (at least) two ramifications\&. Note this is no longer the default \-
\fBscons\fR
installed via
Python\*(Aqs
\fBpip\fR
installer will have a
\fBscons\&.exe\fR
which does not have these limitations:
.PP
First, Windows command\-line users that want to use variable assignment on the command line may have to put double quotes around the assignments, otherwise the Windows command shell will consume those as arguments to itself, not to
\fBscons\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBscons "FOO=BAR" "BAZ=BLEH"\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Second, the Cygwin shell does not recognize typing
\fBscons\fR
at the command line prompt as referring to this wrapper\&. You can work around this either by executing
\fBscons\&.bat\fR
(including the extension) from the Cygwin command line, or by creating a wrapper shell script named
scons
which invokes
scons\&.bat\&.
.SS "MinGW"
.PP
The MinGW
bin
directory must be in your
\fBPATH\fR
environment variable or the
\fI[\*(AqENV\*(Aq][\*(AqPATH\*(Aq]\fR
construction variable
for
\fBscons\fR
to detect and use the MinGW tools\&. When running under the native Windows
Python
interpreter,
\fBscons\fR
will prefer the MinGW tools over the Cygwin tools, if they are both installed, regardless of the order of the bin directories in the
\fBPATH\fR
variable\&. If you have both MSVC and MinGW installed and you want to use MinGW instead of MSVC, then you must explicitly tell
\fBscons\fR
to use MinGW by passing
tools=[\*(Aqmingw\*(Aq]
to the
\fBEnvironment\fR
function, because
\fBscons\fR
will prefer the MSVC tools over the MinGW tools\&.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
In general,
\fBscons\fR
is not controlled by environment variables set in the shell used to invoke it, leaving it up to the
SConscript
file author to import those if desired\&. However, the following variables are imported by
\fBscons\fR
itself if set:
.PP
\fBSCONS_LIB_DIR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the directory that contains the
\fBscons\fR
Python

\fBSCONS_CACHE_MSVC_CONFIG\fR

(Windows only)\&. If set, save the shell environment variables generated when setting up the
