    Fix WIN32_OVERRIDE_ALLOCATORS for VS2017

    At first I try to add some functions as what Chrome does at their
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/base/allocator/allocator_shim_override_ucrt_symbols_win.h,
    but it still fails. So I decide to remove all heap-related objects
    from libucrt.lib to see what happens. At the end I find that a lot of
    functions in the CRT directly invoke _malloc_base instead of
    malloc (and the others alike), hence we need to override them as well.

    This should close issue #716.

    Really fix CheckAddressBits compilation warning

    It looks like previous fix introduced another warning on gcc for
    i386. Somehow it barked on kAddressBits shift even that shift was dead
    code.

    Anyways, we now avoid possibility of undefined shift even
    stronger. And it actually removes compile warning on all compilers I
    tested.

    unbreak compilation on GNU/Linux i386

    Recent commit to fix int overflow for implausibly huge allocation
    added call to std::min. Notably, first arg was old size divided by
    unsigned long 4. And on GNU/Linux i386 size_t is not long. So such
    division was promoting first arg to unsigned long while second arg was
    still size_t, so just unsigned. And that caused compilation to fail.

    Fix is droping 'ul'.

    Enable tcmalloc VDSO support only on x86 to reduce static initializers

    Background context
    ------------------
    crrev.com/1466173002 switched the GN tcmalloc target from source_set
    -> static_library. There are good reasons for keeping tcmalloc a
    source_set (see "Note on static libraries" in [1]).  However, in the
    current state source_set was exposing extra static initializers in the
    GN build which, are not present in the gyp build due to the linker gc
    sections.

    Resolution of this CL
    ---------------------
    The fact that vdso_support.cc is GC-ed by the linker is the symptom
    that such code is unreachable. A search in the codebase shows that the
    only client is stacktrace_x86-inl.h, which depends on VDSO only when
    defined(__linux__) && defined(__i386__) This CL is therefore matching
    this condition in vdso_support.h and conditioning the #define
    HAVE_VDSO_SUPPORT with the same conditions.

    Don't test OOM handling of debugallocator

    This may fix issue #969.

    When testing OOM handling we set up sys allocator that fails memory
    allocation. But debugallocator itself allocates some internal metadata
    memory via malloc and crashes if those allocations fail. So
    occasionally this test failed when debugallocator's internal malloc
    ended up causing sys allocator.

    So instead of failing tests from time to time, we drop it for debug
    allocator. It's OOM handling is already crashy anyways.

    Add a central free list for kMaxPages-sized spans

    Previously, the central free list with index '0' was always unused,
    since freelist index 'i' tracked spans of length 'i' and there are no
    spans of length 0. This meant that there was no freelist for spans of
    length 'kMaxPages'. In the default configuration, this corresponds to
    1MB, which is a relatively common allocation size in a lot of
    applications.

    This changes the free list indexing so that index 'i' tracks spans of
    length 'i + 1', meaning that free list index 0 is now used and
    freelist[kMaxPages - 1] tracks allocations of kMaxPages size (1MB by
    default).

    This also fixes the stats output to indicate '>128' for the large
    spans
    stats rather than the incorrect '>255' which must have referred to a
    historical value of kMaxPages.

    No new tests are added since this code is covered by existing tests.

    implement more robust detection of sized delete support

    As reported in issue #954, osx clang compiler is able to optimize our
    previous detection away while not really having runtime support for
    sized delete. So this time we use AC_LINK_IFELSE and more robust code
    to prevent compiler from optimizing away sized delete call. This
    should reliably catch "bad" compilers.

    fix and verifying it.

    Implemented O(log n) searching among large spans

    This is implemented via std::set with custom STL allocator that
    delegates to PageHeapAllocator. Free large spans are not linked
    together via linked list, but inserted into std::set. Spans also store
    iterators to std::set positions pointing to them. So that removing
    span from set is fast too.

    Patch implemented by Aliaksey Kandratsenka and Todd Lipcon based on
    earlier research and experimentation by James Golick.

    implement fast-path for memalign/aligned_alloc/tc_new_aligned

    We're taking advantage of "natural" alignedness of our size classes
    and instead of previous loop over size classes looking for suitably
    aligned size, we now directly compute right size. See align_size_up
    function. And that gives us ability to use our existing malloc
    fast-path to make memalign neat and fast in most common
    cases. I.e. memalign/aligned_alloc now only tail calls and thus avoids
    expensive prologue/epilogue and is almost as fast as regular malloc.

    always define empty PERFTOOLS_NOTHROW

    Because somehow clang still builds "this function will not throw" code
    even with noexcept. Which breaks performance of
    tc_malloc/tc_new_nothrow. The difference with throw() seems to be just
    which function is called when unexpected exception happens.

    So we work around this sillyness by simply dropping any exception
    specification when compiling tcmalloc.

    unbreak throw declarations on operators new/delete

    We now clearly separate PERFTOOLS_NOTHROW (used for tc_XXX functions)
    and throw()/noexcept (used for operators we define).

    The former is basically "nothrow() for our callers, nothing for
    us". It is roughly equivalent of what glibc declares for malloc and
    friends. If some exception-full C++ code calls such function it
    doesn't have to bother setting up exception handling around such
    call. Notably, it is still important for those functions to _not have
    throw() declarations when we're building tcmalloc. Because C++ throw()
    requires setting up handling of unexpected exceptions thrown from
    under such functions which we don't want.

    The later is necessary to have operators new/delete definitions have
    "correct" exception specifications to calm down compiler
    warnings. Particularly older clang versions warn if new/delete aren't
    defined with correct exception specifications. Also this commit fixes
    annoying gcc 7+ warning (and gnu++14 mode) that complains about
    throw() being deprecated.

    Fix OOM handling in fast-path

    Previous fast-path malloc implementation failed to arrange proper oom
    handling for operator new. I.e. operator new is supposed to call new
    handler and throw exception, which was not arranged in fast-path case.

    Fixed code now passes pointer for oom function to
    ThreadCache::FetchFromCentralCache which will call it in oom
    condition. Test is added to verify correct behavior.

    I've also updated some fast-path-related comments for more accuracy.

    Add support for C++17 operator new/delete for overaligned types.

    - Add auto-detection of std::align_val_t presence to configure
    scripts. This
      indicates that the compiler supports C++17 operator new/delete
      overloads
      for overaligned types.

    - Add auto-detection of -faligned-new compiler option that appeared
    in gcc 7.
      The option allows the compiler to generate calls to the new
      operators. It is
      needed for tests.

    - Added overrides for the new operators. The overrides are enabled
    if the
      support for std::align_val_t has been detected. The implementation
      is mostly
      based on the infrastructure used by memalign, which had to be
      extended to
      support being used by C++ operators in addition to C functions. In
      particular,
      the debug version of the library has to distinguish memory
      allocated by
      memalign from that by operator new. The current implementation
      of sized
      overaligned delete operators do not make use of the supplied
      size argument
      except for the debug allocator because it is difficult to calculate
      the exact
      allocation size that was used to allocate memory with
      alignment. This can be
      done in the future.

    - Removed forward declaration of std::nothrow_t. This was not
    portable as
      the standard library is not required to provide nothrow_t
      directly in
      namespace std (it could use e.g. an inline namespace within
      std). The <new>
      header needs to be included for std::align_val_t anyway.

    - Fixed operator delete[] implementation in libc_override_redefine.h.

    - Moved TC_ALIAS definition to the beginning of the file in
    tcmalloc.cc so that
      the macro is defined before its first use in nallocx.

    - Added tests to verify the added operators.

    Fix data race setting size_left_ in ThreadCache::SetMaxSize

    This commit is to fix the data race in ThreadCache::SetMaxSize.
    ThreadCache::size_left_ is removed and ThreadCache::size_ is
    added. ThreadCache::size_left_ was introduced for optimization.
    It is updated in several functions of ThreadCache, including the
    ThreadCache::SetMaxSize. But thread A can update size_left_ of
    thread B via SetMaxSize without protection or synchronization.

    There should not be data race around ThreadCache::size_, for it
    isn't accessed by multi threads.

    The optimization of tail-call in tc_{malloc, new, free} is kept
    and no other logics are affected.

    Register tcmalloc atfork handler as early as possible

    This is what other mallocs do (glibc malloc and jemalloc). The idea is
    malloc is usually initialized very eary. So if we register atfork
    handler at that time, we're likely to be first. And that makes our
    atfork handler a bit safer, since there is much less chance of some
    other library installing their "take all locks" handler first and
    having fork take malloc lock before library's lock and deadlocking.

    This should address issue #904.

    Revert "Revert "disable dynamic sized delete support by default""

    This reverts commit b82d89cb7c8781a6028f6f5959cabdc5a273aec3.

    Dynamic sized delete support relies on ifunc handler being able to
    look up environment variable. The issue is, when stuff is linked with
    -z now linker flags, all relocations are performed early. And sadly
    ifunc relocations are not treated specially. So when ifunc handler
    runs, it cannot rely on any dynamic relocations at all, otherwise
    crash is real possibility. So we cannot afford doing it until (and if)
    ifunc is fixed.

    This was brought to my attention by Fedora people at
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1452813

    actually support very early freeing of NULL

    This was caught by unit tests on centos 5. Apparently some early
    thingy is trying to do vprintf which calls free(0). Which used to
    crash since before size class cache is initialized it'll report
    hit (with size class 0) for NULL pointer, so we'd miss the case of
    checking NULL pointer free and crash.

    The fix is to check for IsInited in the case when thread cache is
    null, and if so then we escalte to free_null_or_invalid.

    change default transfer batch back to 32

    Some tensorflow benchmarks are seeing large regression with elevated
    values. So lets stick to old safe default until we understand how
    to make
    larger values work for all workloads.

    support different number of size classes at runtime

    With TCMALLOC_TRANSFER_NUM_OBJ environment variable we can change
    transfer batch size. And with that comes slightly different number of
    size classes depending on value of transfer batch size.

    We used to have hardcoded number of size classes, so we couldn't
    really support any batch size setting.

    This commit adds support for dynamic number of size classes (runtime
    value returned by Static::num_size_classes()).

    massage allocation and deallocation fast-path for performance

    This is significant speedup of fast-path of malloc. Large part comes
    from avoiding expensive function prologue/epilogue. Which is achieved
    by making sure that tc_{malloc,new,free} etc are small functions that
    do only tail-calls. We keep only critical path in those functions and
    tail-call to slower "full" versions when we need to deal with less
    common case. This helps compiler generate much tidier code.

    Fast-path readyness check is now different too. We used to have "min
    size for slow path" variable, which was set to non-zero value when we
    know that thread cache is present and ready. We now have use
    thread-cache pointer not equal to NULL as readyness check.

    There is special ThreadCache::threadlocal_data_.fast_path_heap copy of
    that pointer that can be temporarily nulled to disable malloc fast
    path. This is used to enable emergency malloc.

    There is also slight change to tracking thread cache size. Instead of
    tracking total size of free list, it now tracks size headroom. This
    allows for slightly faster deallocation fast-path check where we're
    checking headroom to stay above zero. This check is a bit faster than
    comparing with max_size_.

    slightly faster size class cache

    Lower bits of page index are still used as index into hash
    table. Those lower bits are zeroed, or-ed with size class and
    placed into hash table. So checking is just loading value from hash
    table, xoring with higher bits of address and checking if resultant
    value is lower than 128. Notably, size class 0 is not considered
    "invalid" anymore.

    init tcmalloc prior to replacing system alloc

    Currently on windows, we're depending on uninitialized tcmalloc
    variables to detect freeing foreign malloc's chunks. This works
    somewhat by chance due to 0-initialized size classes cache working as
    cache with no values. But this is about to change, so lets do explicit
    initialization.

    use 2-level page map for 48-bit addresses

    48 bits is size of x86-64 and arm64 address spaces. So using 2 levels
    map for them is slightly faster. We keep 3 levels for small-but-slow
    configuration, since 2 levels consume a bit more memory.

    don't declare throw() on malloc funtions since it is faster

    Apparently throw() on functions actually asks compiler to generate
    code
    to detect unexpected exceptions. Which prevents tail calls
    optimization.

    So in order to re-enable this optimization, we simply don't tell
    compiler about throw() at all. C++11 noexcept would be even better,
    but
    it is not universally available yet.

    So we change to no exception specifications. Which at least for gcc &
    clang on Linux (and likely for all ELF platforms, if not just all)
    really eliminates all overhead of exceptions.

    handle duplicate google_malloc frames in malloc hook stack trace

    Subsequent optimization may cause multiple malloc functions in
    google_malloc section to be in call stack. Particularly when fast-path
    malloc function calls slow-path and compiler chooses to implement such
    call as regular call instead of tail-call.

    Because we need stacktrace just until first such function, once
    we find
    innermost such frame, we're simply checking if next outer frame
    is also
    google_malloc and consider it instead.

    fix stack trace capturing in debug malloc

    Particularly, hardcoded skip count was relying on certain behavior of
    compiler. Namely, that tail calls inside DebugDeallocate path are not
    actually implemented as tail calls.

    New implementation is using google_malloc section as a marker
    of malloc
    boundary. But in order for this to work, we have to prevent
    tail-call in
    debugallocation's tc_XXX functions. Which is achieved by doing
    volatile
    read of static variable at the end of such functions.

    aggressive decommit: only free necessary regions and fix O(N²)

    We used to decommit (with MADV_FREE or MADV_DONTNEED) whole combined
    span when freeing span in aggressive decommit mode. The issue with
    that is preceding or following span with which we combined span we're
    freeing could be freed already and fairly large. By passing all of
    that memory to decommit, we force kernel to scan all of those pages.

    When mass-freeing many objects old behavior led to O(N^2) behavior
    since freeing single span could lead to MADV_{FREE,DONTNEED}-ing of
    most of the heap.

    New implementation just does decommit of individual bits as needed.

    While there, I'm also adding locking to calls of
    PageHeap::{Get,Set}AggressiveDecommit.

    This partially (or mostly) fixes issue #839.

    Weirdly, some OSX compiler does allow -fsized-deallocation, yet barks
    on any attempt to actually use it at compile time (!). So lets detect
    this as well in configure and opt out as necessary.

    Should fix issue #870.

    Don't assume memalign exists in memalign vs nallocx test

    OSX and windows have issues with memalign. So test against tc_memalign
    instead.

    This should fix _memalign linker-time part of issue #870.

    rename sys allocator's sys_alloc symbol to tcmalloc_sys_alloc

    Since we're not building with hidden visibility, symbols of other DSOs
    can interpose our symbols. And sys_alloc is just too generic name.

    And in fact erlang runtime has sys_alloc function. Which means we're
    trying to write to it's first bytes as part of initializing system
    allocator and crash.

    This should fix issue #843.

    build malloc_bench_shared_full only when full tcmalloc is built

    I.e. because otherwise, when --enable-minimal is given, we're building
    empty libtcmalloc.la and linking it to malloc_bench_shared_full. Which
    has no effect at all and actually breaks builds on OSX.

    Should fix issue #869.

    ported nallocx support from Google-internal tcmalloc

    nallocx is extension introduced by jemalloc. It returns effective size
    of allocaiton without allocating anything.

    We also support MALLOCX_LG_ALIGN flag. But all other jemalloc
    flags (which at the moment do nothing for nallocx anyways) are
    silently ignored, since there is no sensible way to return errors in
    this API.

    This was originally contributed by Dmitry Vyukov with input from
    Andrew Hunter. But due to significant divergence of Google-internal
    and free-software forks of tcmalloc, significant massaging was done by
    me. So all bugs are mine.

    Looks like _free_base is used as generic free/delete, which is not
    checked for free/delete mismatch by their debug runtime. Issue #817
    occurs because something that is allocated by regular allocation
    functions (new or malloc) is freed by _free_base. Patch it as
    well fixes

    Summary: support gcc atomic ops on clang too

    Clang actually does support __atomic_XXX atomic ops builtins but does
    not advertise itselt as gcc 4.7 or later. So we now detect clang
    separetely.

    We're enabling gcc atomic ops on clang >= 3.4 since this is the oldest
    version that I can test.

    This should fix issue #797.

    Use initial-exec tls for libunwind's recursion flag

    If we don't do it, then reading variable calls to __tls_get_addr,

    uses malloc on first call. initial-exec makes dynamic linker
    reserve tls

    build sized delete aliases even when sized-delete is disabled

    In this case we alias to regular delete. This is helpful because if we
    don't override sized delete, then apps will call version in libstdc++
    which delegates calls to regular delete, which is slower than calling
    regular delete directly.

    alias same malloc/free variants to their canonical versions

    This is similar to what gcc 5 does anyways, except gcc 5 is placing
    jumps which adds a bit of overhead.

    Instead of letting gcc do it, we alias using ELF symbol aliasing. All
    free variants (tc_delete{,array}_{,nothrow}) are aliased to
    tc_free. There are 3 malloc variants that differ by oom
    handling. tc_newarray is aliased to tc_new. And tc_newarray_nothrow is
    aliased to tc_new_nothrow.

    This aliasing only happens in non-debug malloc, since debug malloc
    does
    distinguish between different variants since it needs checking for
    mismatch.

    Since rounding up prior to sampling is introducing possibility of

    implemented stacktrace capturing via libgcc's C++ ABI function

    Particularly _Unwind_Backtrace which seems to be gcc extension.

    This is what glibc's backtrace is commonly is using.

    Using _Unwind_Backtrace directly is better than glibc's backtrace,
    since
    it doesn't call into dlopen. While glibc does dlopen when it is
    built as
    shared library apparently to avoid link-time dependency on libgcc_s.so

    force profiler_unittest to do 'real' work

    'XOR loop' in profiler unittest wasn't 100% effective because
    it allowed

    After marking result variable as volatile, we're now forcing

    profiler_unittest is now passing more consistently.

    Fix include of malloc_hook_c.h in malloc_hook.h

    malloc_hook.h includes malloc_hook_c.h as

    standard include directory (-I), which may not always be the case.

    Instead, include it as "malloc_hook_c.h", which will search in
    the same

    Make sure the alias is not removed by link-time optimization when
    it can prove
    that it isn't used by the program, as it might still be needed to
    override the
    corresponding symbol in shared libraries (or inline assembler for
    that matter).
    For example, suppose the program uses malloc and free but not calloc
    and is
    statically linked against tcmalloc (built with -flto) and LTO
    is done.  Then
    before this patch the calloc alias would be deleted by LTO due to
    not being
    used, but the malloc/free aliases would be kept because they are
    used by the
    program.  Suppose the program is dynamically linked with a shared
    library that
    allocates memory using calloc and later frees it by calling free.
    Then calloc
    will use the libc memory allocator, because the calloc alias was
    deleted, but
    free will call into tcmalloc, resulting in a crash.

    implemented (disabled by default) sized delete support

    gcc 5 and clang++-3.7 support sized deallocation from C++14. We are
    taking advantage of that by defining sized versions of operator
    delete.

    This is off by default so that if some existing programs that
    define own
    global operator delete without sized variant are not broken by
    tcmalloc's sized delete operator.

    There is also risk of breaking exiting code that deletes objects using
    wrong class (i.e. base class) without having virtual destructors.

    correctly test for -Wno-unused-result support

    gcc is only giving warning for unknown -Wno-XXX flags so test never
    fails on gcc even if -Wno-XXX is not supported. By using
    -Wunused-result we're able to test if gcc actually supports it.

    This fixes issue #703.

    While this is still very synthetic and unrepresentave of malloc

    prevent clang from inlining Mallocer in heap checker unittest

    Looks like existing "trick" to avoid inlining doesn't really prevent
    sufficiently smart compiler from inlining Mallocer function. Which
    breaks tests, since test relies Mallocer having it's own separate
    stack
    frame.

    Making mallocer_addr variable volatile is seemingly enough to
    stop that.

    amputate unportable and unused stuff from sysinfo

    We still check number of cpus in the system (in spinlock code),
    but old
    code was built under assumption of "no calls malloc" which is
    not needed
    in tcmalloc. Which caused it to be far more complicated than
    necessary (parsing procfs files, ifdefs for different OSes and
    arch-es).

    Also we don't need clock cycle frequency measurement.

    So I've removed all complexity of ald code and NumCPUs function and
    replaced it with GetSystemCPUsCount which is straightforward and
    portable call to sysconf.

    Renaming of cpus count function was made so that any further code that
    we might port from Google that depends on old semantics of NumCPUs
    will
    be detected at compile time. And has to be inspected for whether it
    really needs that semantics.

    Don't discard curl options if timeout is not defined.

    Editing the options passed to curl via 'my @URL_FETCHER = ("curl",
    "-s");' (in particular to add a -k to ignore self signed certs) fails
    for some invocations of curl. In FetchDynamicProfile, 'my @fetcher =
    AddFetchTimeout($fetch_timeout, @URL_FETCHER);' ends up being just
    'curl' if timeout is not defined.

    This happens because AddFetchTimeout doesn't retrieve all the
    arguments
    from the caller.

    help clang with inlining important fast-path functions

    Clang's recent focus on code size doesn't help us in malloc fast-path
    because somehow clang completely ignores inline directives.

    In order to help clang generate code that was actually intended by
    original authors, we're adding always_inline attribute to key
    fast-path functions.

    Clang also guessed likely branch "wrong" in couple places. Which is
    now addressed by UNLIKELY declarations there.

    always set errno to ENOMEM on OOM condition and in single place

    While standards do not require us to set errno to ENOMEM in certain
    places (like posix_memalign), existing code may sometimes set it
    (i.e. because mmap or sbrk couldn't get memory from kernel)
    anyways. And from my reading of glibc, it's malloc is doing more or
    less same by just always setting ENOMEM on OOM condition.

    This commit also eliminates some functions (XXX_no_errno) that are not
    needed anymore.

    deal with OOM handling in one place and prior to returning result

    This commit removes 4 (four!) duplicates of C++ OOM handling. And
    introduces one helper for that.

    Other change is that malloc doesn't have to check tc_new_mode anymore
    until it _actually_ deals with OOM condition. Which shaves off couple
    instructions from fast-path.

    unbreak heap-profiler-unittest on gcc 5

    gcc 5 has got nice new optimization (-fipa-icf) which merges identical
    functions into one. And that causes heap-profiler_unittest to fail
    since it expects to see both Allocate and Allocate2 in heap
    profiles. And smart GCC detects that they are same function and makes
    one function out of two and thus breaks this test.

    New code simply adds (disabled) logging calls to make those functions
    non-identical.

    issue-702: correctly declare arg-less functions in profiler.h

    This is patch by user mitchblank.

    From his words:

    The problem is pretty simple.  Ancient C code allowed declarations
    without argument prototypes, i.e.

      int foo();

    For compatibility this is still accepted.  If you want to declare a
    function with zero prototypes the correct way to do it is:

       int foo(void);

    C++ also accepts this syntax, but it's not needed there.

    Normally compilers still accept the old-style entries, but with
    sufficient warning flags gcc will complain about them.  It is good for
    header files to have the explicit "void" argument so all compilers are
    kept happy.

    I'm attaching a simple patch to add the "void" parameter to that file.
    I haven't checked if other headers have the same problem (I'm just
    using the profiler at the moment)

    <end of quote>

    In fact "int foo()" means "foo accepts any args" and we really want
    "foo has no args". For which int foo (void) is right declaration.

    pprof: allow disabling auto-removal of "constant 2nd frame"

    "constand 2nd frame" feature is supposed to detect and workaround
    incorrect cpu profile stack captures where parts of or whole cpu
    profiling signal handler frames are not skipped.

    I've seen programs where this feature incorrectly removes non-signal
    frames.

    Plus it actually hides bugs in stacktrace capturing which we want be
    able to spot.

    There is now --no-auto-signal-frm option for disabling it.

    pprof: eliminate duplicate top frames if dropping signal frames

    In cpu profiles that had parts of signal handler we could have
    situation like that:

    * PC
    * signal handler frame
    * PC

    Specifically when capturing stacktraces via libunwind.

    For such stacktraces pprof used to draw self-cycle in functions
    confusing everybody. Given that me might have a number of such
    profiles in the wild it makes sense to treat that duplicate PC issue.

    dropped atopmicops workaround for irrelevant Opteron locking bug

    It's not cheap at all when done in this way (i.e. without runtime
    patching) and apparently useless.

    It looks like Linux kernel never got this workaround at all. See
    bugzilla ticket: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11305

    And I see no traces of this workaround in glibc either.

    On the other hand, opensolaris folks apparently still have it (or
    something similar, based on comments on linux bugzilla) in their code:
    https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/blob/32842aabdc7c6f8f0c6140a256cf42cf5404fefb/usr/src/uts/i86pc/os/mp_startup.c#L1136

    And affected CPUs (if any) are from year 2008 (that's 6 years now).

    Plus even if somebody still uses those cpus (which is unlikely), they
    won't have working kernel and glibc anyways.

Author: Aliaksey Kandratsenka <alk@tut.by>
Date:	Sun Sep 7 13:09:14 2014 -0700

    implemented cpu-profiling mode that profiles threads separately

    Default mode of operation of cpu profiler uses itimer and
    SIGPROF. This timer is by definition per-process and no spec defines
    which thread is going to receive SIGPROF. And it provides correct
    profiles only if we assume that probability of picking threads will be
    proportional to cpu time spent by threads.

    It is easy to see, that recent Linux (at least on common SMP hardware)
    doesn't satisfy that assumption. Quite big skews of SIGPROF ticks
    between threads is visible. I.e. I could see as big as 70%/20%
    division instead of 50%/50% for pair of cpu-hog threads. (And I do see
    it become 50/50 with new mode)

    Fortunately POSIX provides mechanism to track per-thread cpu time via
    posix timers facility. And even more fortunately, Linux also provides
    mechanism to deliver timer ticks to specific threads.

    Interestingly, it looks like FreeBSD also has very similar facility
    and seems to suffer from same skew.  But due to difference in a way
    how threads are identified, I haven't bothered to try to support this
    mode on FreeBSD.

    This commit implements new profiling mode where every thread creates
    posix timer which tracks thread's cpu time. Threads also also set up
    signal delivery to itself on overflows of that timer.

    This new mode requires every thread to be registered in cpu
    profiler. Existing ProfilerRegisterThread function is used for that.

    Because registering threads requires application support (or suitable
    LD_PRELOAD-able wrapper for thread creation API), new mode is off by
    default. And it has to be manually activated by setting environment
    variable CPUPROFILE_PER_THREAD_TIMERS.

    New mode also requires librt symbols to be available. Which we do not
    link to due to librt's dependency on libpthread.  Which we avoid due
    to perf impact of bringing in libpthread to otherwise single-threaded
    programs. So it has to be either already loaded by profiling program
    or LD_PRELOAD-ed.

    issue-654: [pprof] handle split text segments

    This applies patch by user simonb.

    Quoting:

    Relocation packing splits a single executable load segment into two.
    Before:

      LOAD	     0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x2034d28 0x2034d28
      R E 0x1000
      LOAD	     0x2035888 0x02036888 0x02036888 0x182d38 0x1a67d0
      RW  0x1000

    After:
      LOAD	     0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x14648 0x14648 R
      E 0x1000
      LOAD	     0x014648 0x0020c648 0x0020c648 0x1e286e0 0x1e286e0
      R E 0x1000
      ...
      LOAD	     0x1e3d888 0x02036888 0x02036888 0x182d38 0x1a67d0
      RW  0x1000

    The .text section is in the second LOAD, and this is not at
    offset/address zero.  The result is that this library shows up in
    /proc/self/maps as multiple executable entries, for example (note:
    this trace is not from the library dissected above, but rather from an
    earlier version of it):

      73b0c000-73b21000 r-xp 00000000 b3:19 786460
      /data/.../libchrome.2160.0.so
      73b21000-73d12000 ---p 00000000 00:00 0
      73d12000-75a90000 r-xp 00014000 b3:19 786460
      /data/.../libchrome.2160.0.so
      75a90000-75c0d000 rw-p 01d91000 b3:19 786460
      /data/.../libchrome.2160.0.so

    When parsing this, pprof needs to merge the two r-xp entries above
    into a single entry, otherwise the addresses it prints are incorrect.

    The following fix against 2.2.1 was sufficient to make pprof --text
    print the correct output.  Untested with other pprof options.

    Fix parsing /proc/pid/maps dump in CPU profile data file

    When trying to use pprof on my machine, the symbols of my program were
    not being recognized.

    It turned out that pprof, when calculating the offset of the text list
    of mapped objects (the last section of the CPU profile data file), was
    assuming that the slot size was always 4 bytes, even on 64-bit
    machines.

    This led to ParseLibraries() reading a lot of garbage data at the
    beginning of the map, and consequently the regex was failing to
    match on
    the first line of the real (non-garbage) map.

    Quoting from email:

    I had the same question as William posted to stack overflow back on
    Dec 9,2013: How to display symbols in stack trace of google-perftools
    heap profiler (*).	I dug into the source and realized the
    functionality was not there but could be added. I am hoping that
    someone else will find this useful/helpful.

    The patch I created will not attach so I am adding below.

    Enjoy!

    PowerPC: stacktrace function refactor and fixes

    This patch fixes the stacktrace creating when the function is
    interrupted by a signal. For Linux, the vDSO signal trampoline
    symbol is
    compared against LR from stack backchain and handled different in that
    case (since the signal trampoline layout a different stack frame).

    Because of this extensive change the PowerPC stacktrace code has now
    been refactored to split in Linux and Darwin specific codes.

    function.

    This is port of corresponding chromium change at:
    https://codereview.chromium.org/55333002/

    Basic idea is that sometimes apps that use tc_set_new_mode in order to
    have C++ out-of-memory handler catch OOMs in malloc, need to invoke
    usual malloc that returns 0 on OOM.

    That new API is exactly for that. It'll always return NULL on OOM even
    if tc_new_mode is set to true.

    speed up MallocExtension::instance()

    It was reported that pthread_once is expensive, especially on ppc.

    In new implementation in hot path instead of doing potentially
    expensive atomic read with barrier, we do just plain read.

    It's slightly less robust than older implementation, but it should be
    faster.

    New code is making assumption that programs do not spawn threads
    before main() is called. And therefore all variables & modules are
    initialized before threads are created. Which looks like pretty safe
    assumption. With that assumption, doing plain read is safe, because
    current_instance is initialized as part of module init and therefore
    before threads are spawned.

    This patch is based on feedback of Adhemerval Zanella.

    issue-613: remove friend declaration from HeapLeakChecker

    This applies patch by davide.italiano@10gen.com:

    heap-checker.h contains the following friend declaration of main:
    friend int main(int, char**).

    C99 allows another declaration of main, i.e. int main(int, char**,
    char**), and if code uses it and includes the heap-checker header,
    this might result in a conflict, e.g.

    error: declaration of C function 'int main(int, char**, char**)'
    conflicts with
     int main(int argc, char* argv[], char** envp)

    Actually the comment above the friend declaration of main() mentions
    that this is required to get the unittest working and for other
    internal usage, but I'm not completely sure if this is true as long as
    I'm able to build and run the unittest removing the declaration.

    issue-489: implemented API to set chromium-style de-committing

    Chrome has code to decommit (release back to OS) every span that's
    released. I don't want to make it default, but indeed some
    applications may want to enable this mode.

    The code itself is taken from 2-way-merging of code from Chromium
    fork.

    issue-489: ported chromium windows decommitting code

    I tried to do it cleanly with merges but chromium code has so many
    relevant commits (with frequent reverts) that makes it near
    impossible.

    Simpler 2-way emerge-files worked in the end. I've removed chromium's
    aggressive 'always decommit' behavior which I want to make optional
    later.

    Majority of this work is the following commits (but there are more,
    particularly against port.cc):

	Major changes to the Chrome allocator.

	Changes include:
	* Fix tcmalloc to release memory.  Implements the
	TCMalloc_SystemCommit()
	  mechanism so that tcmalloc can implement SystemRelease()
	  and later
	  reuse that memory.
	* Enable dynamic switching of allocators based on an environment
	variable.
	  Users can now switch between tcmalloc, jemalloc, the default
	  windows
	  heap, and the windows low-fragmentation heap.
	* Implements set_new_mode() across all allocators so that we
	can be sure
	  that out-of-memory conditions are handled safely.

	BUG=18345
	TEST=none; plan to get all unit tests running through these
	allocators.

    added debugallocation check for offset_ corruption

    It was previously possible (although unlikely) for damaged offset_

    to lead FromRawPointer implementation into different MallocBlock.

    possible time.

    avoid crash in DebugMallocImplementation::GetOwnership

    It was possible that if GetOwnership is passed pointer to memory not
    owned by tcmalloc, it would crash. Or incorrectly return
    owned. I.e. due to indirection in FromRawPointer.

    New implementation prevents that, but introduces different bug
    instead. New implementation incorrectly returns "not owned" for
    memalign chunks with big alignment. But in can be argued that passing
    pointer returned from different memalign implementation did not work
    previously too.

    debug memalign is creating special header block to allow us to find

    linux_syscall_support.h: add aarch64 support

    Aarch64 support for linux_syscall_support.h. Since Aarch64 is a brand
    new architecture, none of the legacy system calls are neccesarily
    available. Thus some changes were neccesary affect other architectures
    as well:

    1) use getdents64 where available and else getdents (for ppc64)

    2) other legacy system calls, pipe, waitpid and open replaced
    by pipe2,
       wait4 and openat where available.

    3) use fstatat if stat is not available.

    The aarch64 system call interface follows the Aarch64 calling
    convention
    (regs x0-x5 for arguments and x8 system call number - return in x0).
    Clone implementation is adapted from glibc.

    implement atomics with gcc intrinsics

    Gcc after 4.7 provides atomic builtins[1]. Use these instead of adding
    yet-another-assembly port for Aarch64 (64-bit ARM). This patch enables
    succesfully building and running atomicops unittest on Aarch64.

    This patch enables using gcc builtins only when no assembly
    implementation is provided. But as a quick check, atomicops_unittest
    and rest of testsuite passes with atomicops-internals-gcc also
    ARMv7 and X86_64 if the ifdef in atomicops is adjusted to prefer
    the generic implementation.

    issue-{66,547}: use signal's ucontext when unwinding backtrace

    In issue-66 (and readme) it is pointed out that sometimes there are
    some issues grabbing backtrace across signal handler boundary.

    This code attempts to fix it by grabbing backtrace from signal's
    ucontext which clearly does not include signal handler boundary.

    We're using "feature" of libunwind that for some important platforms
    libunwind's context is same as libc's ucontext_t which is given to us
    as part of calling signal handler.

    issue-581: avoid destructing DebugMallocImplementation

    Because otherwise destructor might be invoked well before other places
    that might touch malloc extension instance.

    We're using placement new to initialize it and pass pointer to

    never run.

    Based on idea suggested by Andrew C. Morrow.

    issue-586: detect main executable even if PIE is active

    Previous logic of detecting main program addresses is to assume that
    main executable is at least addressess. With PIE (active by default on
    Ubuntus) it doesn't work.

    In order to deal with that, we're attempting to find main executable
    mapping in /proc/[pid]/maps. And old logic is preserved too just in

    Added AM_MAINTAINER_MODE to disable Makefile rebuild rules

    Some people might want to check-in unpacked result on make dist into
    git. But because git doesn't preserve timestamps it would cause those
    automatic "auto-retool" rules to trigger. Sometimes even causing build
    breakage if system's autotools version don't match autotools version
    used for make dist.

    Easiest way around this problem is to simply disable those unnecessary
    "maintainer" rebuild rules. Especially given that source is always
    freely available via git and therefore there should be no reason to
    regenerate any of autotools products in 'make dist'-produced sources.

    As suggested by Hannes Weisbach.

    Call heap-profiler_unittest with the arguments 1 -2 (one iteration, 2
    fork()ed children).

    Instead of running the test, the program crashes with a std::bad_alloc
    exception.	This is caused by unconditionally passing the
    number-of-threads-argument (0 or positive for threads, negative for
    fork()s) in RunManyThreads(), thus allocating an array of pthread_t of
    size -2.  Depending on the sign of the thread number argument either
    RunManyThreads or fork() should be called.

    central_freelist: change fetch ordering

    When we fetch objects from the span for thread cache, we make
    reverse-ordered list against original list on the span and suppy
    this list
    to thread cache. This algorithm has trouble with newly created span.
    Newly created span has ascending ordered objects list. Since thread
    cache
    will get reverse-ordered list against it, user gets objects as
    descending order.

    Following example shows what occurs in this algorithm.

    new span: object list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> ...
    fetch N items: N -> N-1 -> N-2 -> ... -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL
    thread cache: N -> N-1 -> N-2 -> ... -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL

    user's 1st malloc: N
    user's 2nd malloc: N-1
    ...
    user's Nth malloc: 1

    In general, access memory with ascending order is better than
    descending
    order in terms of the performance. So this patch fix this situation.

    I run below program to measure performance effect.

	    #define MALLOC_SIZE (512)
	    #define CACHE_SIZE (64)
	    #define TOUCH_SIZE (512 / CACHE_SIZE)

	    array = malloc(sizeof(void *) * count);

	    for (i = 0; i < 1; i++) {
		    for (j = 0; j < count; j++) {
			    x = malloc(MALLOC_SIZE);
			    array[j] = x;
		    }
	    }

	    repeat = 10;
	    for (i = 0; i < repeat; i++) {
		    for (j = 0; j < count; j++) {
			    x = array[j];
			    for (k = 0; k < TOUCH_SIZE; k++) {
				    *(x + (k * CACHE_SIZE)) = '1';
			    }
		    }
	    }

    skip unnecessary check during double-check SizeClass intergrity

    On initialization step, tcmalloc double-checks SizeClass integrity
    with
    all possible size values, 0 to kMaxSize. This causes tremendous
    overhead
    for short-lived applications.

    For example, consider following command.
    'find -exec grep something {} \;'

    Actual work of each grep is really small, but double-check requires
    more work. To reduce this overhead, it is best to remove double-check
    entirely. But we cannot be sure the integrity without double-checking,
    so alternative is needed.

    This patch doesn't remove double-check, instead, try to skip
    unnecessary
    check based on ClassIndex() implementation. This reduce much
    overhead and
    the code has same coverage as previous double-check. Following is
    the result of this patch.

    issue-557: added support for dumping heap profile via signal

    This applies patch from Jean Lee.

    I've reformatted it to match surronding code style and changed
    validation logic a bit. I.e. we're not checking signal for range
    anymore given we're not sure what different platforms support, but
    we're checking return value of signal() for SIG_ERR instead.

    issue-536: do not PrintStats if running under valgrind

    When we detect running under valgrind we do not initialize our own
    malloc. So trying to print malloc stats when asked via MALLOCSTATS
    cannot work.

    This does fix proposed by Philippe Waroquiers. In which we detect
    running under valgrind prior to checking MALLOCSTATS environment
    variable and refuse printing stats if we detect valgrind.

    issue-413: disable __thread usage on OSX

    Because it was found that __thread variables access is compiled into
    calls to tlv_get_addr which was found to call malloc. Because we
    actually use thread-local storage from inside malloc it leads to stack
    overflow. So we'll continue using pthreads API for that which is known
    to work on OSX.

    issue-560: Revert "issue-481: ...

    ...Replaced test mechanism for distinct address spaces with a more
    reliable mechanism"

    This reverts commit 5dd53ab6cbf9d98f2d60546835e84785a104da46 (svn
    revision 167)

    With this commit rhel 6.2 fails heap-checker-death_unittest and
    without it passes.

    Ticket refers to 2 things and both are invalid:

    * that ptrace PEEKDATA ignores data argument. I've checked kernel
      source and found it to be wrong

    * something about distinct address spaces

    And in addition to all that original ticket admits that it doesn't fix
    anything.

    It looks like, compared to original code that "fix" is not succesfully
    wait-ing on parent's ptrace request. I.e. by adding some additional
    diagnostics I'm seeing this sys_waitpid returning ECHILD.

    Which gcc-3.4 (as shipped in rhel 4) doesn't like.

    Cast to void * was originally added to avoid issue on OSX which
    doesn't have sighandler_t.

    In that place we only need to know if it's null or not. So casting to
    intptr_t looks like simplest possible way to achieve that.

    issue-502: Count m(un)map for each stacktrace in MemoryRegionMap

    ..instead of HeapProfileTable

    This upstreams chromium commit reviewed at:
    https://codereview.chromium.org/12388070

    Original and upstreaming author is: Dai MIKURUBE

    This patch fixes a bug that gperftools(TCMalloc)'s mmap profiler
    (HEAP_PROFILE_MMAP) doesn't hook some memory pages used by the
    profiler itself.

    This problem has been lived in gperftools for a long time.
    It is discussed in gperftools' issue 502.
    https://code.google.com/p/gperftools/issues/detail?id=502

    Some bugs in the mmap profiler were fixed by
    https://code.google.com/p/gperftools/issues/detail?id=383,
    but the patch in the issue 383 didn't fix the bug mentioned in
    the issue 502.

    This change reverts the previous patch and http://crrev.com/132771
    at first. Then, it modifies MemoryRegionMap to count m(un)map
    calls for each stacktrace in itself instead of merging the counts
    for each stacktrace in HeapProfileTable.

    This change also cleans up heap-profiler, heap-profile-table and
    deep-heap-profile.

    issue-552: Fix page_heap_test for system with different page size

    This is patch by Adhemerval Zanella.

    PowerPC uses 64K page size instead of 4k for x86 and x86_64. It
    makes the
    page_heap_test fails because the following test:

     static bool HaveSystemRelease =
	TCMalloc_SystemRelease(TCMalloc_SystemAlloc(kPageSize, NULL,
	0), kPageSize);

    will always fail if kPageSize is less than getpagesize() (the default
    configuration).

    The following patch fixes it by trying to allocate/deallocate
    an entire
    page instead.

    This is patch by Adhemerval Zanella.

    * src/stacktrace_powerpc-inl.h: It is just a cleanup for the

      functions for PowerPC. The idea is to simplify the code.
    * src/tests/heap-checker_unittest.cc: Handles the PPC64 function
    descriptor
      correctly in malloc tracers. Different from other architecture,
      for PPC64
      the address returned in function pointers are the ODP entry, not the
      symbol address in .text segment. This leads the comparison bogus,
      since
      it will compare a ODP entry with a .text address.
    * src/heap-checker.cc: Add support for PPC in ptrace.
    * src/base/elfcore.h: Likewise.
    * src/base/linuxthreads.cc: Fix the thread creation using the clone
    wrapper.
    * src/base/linux_syscall_support.h: Various fixes for PPC32 and PPC64:
      fixes the kernel_stat[64] struct layout, and sys_clone and
      sys_socket
      implementation.

    issue-511: fixed negative offset handling for conditional jumps

    While doing and testing issue-511 I've found one subtle bug which is
    incorrect handling of short offsets. They are defined to be signed but
    previous code used unsigned char for them which caused negative
    offsets to look like larger positive offsets. Fix is trivial.

    issue-511: recognise rex.w jmpq *<literal>(%rip) as iat jump

    Apparently Windows Server 2012 (and presumably windows 8) now has this
    form of iat jump. Which is quite useless (rex.w is according to my
    understanding is not needed at all) but because of rex.w our code to
    recognize jumps like that didn't work.

    Fix is just skip this prefix.

    issue-511: implemented rel8 jump patching

    I've found that Visual Studio 2012 release 32-bit C runtime library
    patching fails because array new has rel8 jmp which previous code
    could not handle.

    Implementation is largely copied from conditional jumps handling code.

    issue-{368,443}: allocate metadata in big batches

    It uses same approach as PageHeapAllocator. Namely allocates big chunk
    which is then used to satisfy smaller allocations.

    In issue-443 gradual heap grows causes old code that allocates
    metadata in smaller pieces and thus more frequently to fragment the
    heap. It's also causing most of 368 heap fragmentation too.

    New code allocates 8 megs of address space at once for metadata
    allocations. Most OSes will allocate actual memory only when
    corresponding pages are touched. Thus this change should not cause
    increased memory usage.

    I've also made sure metadata is always properly aligned in case we
    ever allocate something that breaks natural alignment. E.g. strings.

    issue-368: unmap free spans and retry before growing heap

    Because unmapped spans are not coalesced with normal spans it's
    possible that we indeed have a large enough free span, but we fail to
    see that because we always consider unmapped and normal spans
    separately. That behavior is more likely for larger spans.

    In order to protect programs that grow heap frequently and by small
    amounts from much more frequent minor page faults, there's limit of
    running that force pages unmap path once per 128 megs of heap growth.

    issue-506: fixed bogus unit test failure

    Looks like my version of GCC is aware that free(malloc(X)) is a
    no-op. So it optimizes that away completely ignoring simple fact that
    we're observing malloc hooks invocations. By adding check that malloc
    succeeded we force gcc to actually preserve that malloc call.

    issue-496: Fixes an issue where tcmalloc might deadlock in a thread
    calling fork

    tcmalloc contained a bug where some internal locks were left in a
    undefined state
    between fork, leaving the child process in a deadlock state. This
    patch fixes the
    issue by introducing stricter locking between the parent nd child
    while forking.

    issue-491: Significant performance improvement for spin lock
    contention

    This patch fixes issues where spinlocks under contention were
    failing to
    wakeup waiters, sometimes resulting in blow ups from 13ns to as high
    as 256ms.
    Under heavy contention, applications were observed sleeping for
    minutes at a
    time giving the appearance of a hang.

    issue-443: Increase the number of objects transferred between thread
    cache and central free list

    This fix is a result of a performance degradation observed in
    multi-threaded programs where large
    amounts of memory (30GB) are consumed, released by a pool of threads
    in a cyclic manner. This was
    mainly due to the amount of time we were spending in the slow path
    consolidating memory between
    the thread cache and central free list. The default has been bumped
    up to 32768 and is now also
    controllable through the TCMALLOC_TRANSFER_NUM_OBJ environment
    setting.

    issue-465: Adding automagic support for __builtin_expect

    Previously __builtin_ expect was based on a macro check against

    Now we perform the check via AM which is a cleaner approach. There
    are also
    a number of code changes here to utilize LIKELY/UNLIKELY macros
    based on

    issue-488: Performance improvement for initialization checks

    These came in from the Google-internal version of tcmalloc. They
    saw some
    decent speed improvements, both on microbenchmarks and big
    programs. The
    idea is to improve the speed of the "Is everything initialized?" type
    of
    code, that's at the start of all allocations and deallocations.

    issue-483: Speed up accesses to ClassIndex()

    Making its return type unsigned can save a conversion from
    signed to unsigned, and getting rid of the ternary operators
    seems to help a little bit as well. Various gcc versions weren't
    generating conditional moves for them as one would expect.

    issue-452: Adds a control mechanism to the cpu profiler to be switched
    on and off using a user defined signal.

    CPUPROFILESIGNAL - Takes a signal number between the value of 1 and
    64 inclusive which represents a signal
		       number as defined by signal.h. The signal must
		       not be in use by the program. Sending this
		       signal to the program turns profiling on and off
		       like a switch. By default the switch is
		       off when the program starts. Successive profiles
		       are suffixed with a monotonically increasing
		       number.

    issue-481: Replaced test mechanism for distinct address spaces with
    a more reliable mechanism

    Rather than using sys_ptrace+PTRACE_PEEK_DATA to determine whether
    address spaces are distinct, we now use sys_waitpid+__WCLONE. See
    issue-481 for a more detailed rationale.

    issue-437 Fixed issues related to new glibc shipped with Ubuntu 10.10

    1. ptrace permissions were modifed to be a bit more strict which
    required
       us to programatically set the permissions while syncing up to
       the profiling
       thread.

    2. Order of destructors registered with atexit changed which was
    casuing us to
       miss generating the backtrace when heap checker was finished. Seems
       that we
       initially fixed this for FreeBSD and now linux has changed their
       behaviour
       to be the same. We are now a bit stricter on the rules here
       accross all
       platforms.

    Last of the remnant empty directories that I don't know why they're
    there.

    This directory got renamed tmu-static a long time ago.  Get rid of
    this ancient remnant.

    Apparently I'm not good at deleting files from svn after they're no

	    Add the magical incantations to get perftools to compile
	    cleanly under windows.  The only non-trivial one is the #undef
	    of small, which I needed to compile under the latest cygwin --
	    I ran g++ with -dD under cygwin and saw the '#define small
	    char' with my own eyes.  I wouldn't have thought it...

	    In my testing for a new release, I was noticing hangs on
	    cygwin, that went away when I turned off tls support.  Since I
	    didn't use to have such problems, I am being conservative and
	    only turning off TLS for the particular version of cygwin I'm
	    testing on (as returned by uname()).

	    We use mmx instructions now in perftools, so specify -xmms for
	    gcc on i386, where it's not on by default (it is for
	    gcc/x86_64, in my tests).  This could potentially cause an
	    error for embedded systems, which can have i386 but no mms,
	    but the code wouldn't run properly on them anyway without
	    tweaks.

	    * Speed up IsSymbolizedProfile by checking for NUL (csilvers)
	    * Fix heap sampling to use correct alloc size (bmaurer)
	    * Make pprof ignore tc_new{,array}_nothrow (csilvers)
	    * PORTING: Have IsHeapProfilerRunning return an int, for C
	    (csilvers)
	    * Avoid false-sharing of memory between caches (bmaurer)
	    * Fix some variable shadowing (rt)
	    * SVG-based ouptut in pprof; also, wget->curl (rsc)
	    * Allow arbitrary prefix before obvious handler (rsc)
	    * Advertise when using libunwind (ppluzhnikov)

    Also, the install file seems to have reverted back to the default at
    some previous point in time (autotools will do that occasionally).
    Change that back to have the perftools-specific text in there.

commit 104bf697fbd2a0b90b5f01344ee01c8caa1745d0
Author: csilvers <csilvers@6b5cf1ce-ec42-a296-1ba9-69fdba395a50>

    Use the google spinlock code instead of the built-in windows code.
    The main benefit for perftools is that google spinlocks allow for
    link-time (static) initialization, which we had to simulate before,
    yielding bugs and worse performance.

    In the case of windows with HAS_EXCEPTIONS turned off we weren't able
    to use the std::set_new_handler correctly.	Rework the #ifdefs to
    allow use of the std_new_handler, but ignore the exceptions.

    Patch submitted by mbelshe.

    1) Change #include "config.h" to <config.h>.  This is what automake
    recommends, and makes it easier to override a config file.

    2) Rename OS_WINDOWS in sysinfo.cc, to not conflict with a macro
    defined in a windows SDK somewhere.

commit 74ad5d57ec08abace386befc6c3c695d85f44d1a

    Fri Apr 13 14:50:51 2007  Google Inc. <opensource@google.com>

	    * google-perftools: version 0.90 release
	    * (As the version-number jump hints, this is a major new
	    release:
	      almost every piece of functionality was rewritten.
	      I can't do
	      justice to all the changes, but will concentrate on
	      highlights.)
	    *** USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
	    * Ability to "release" unused memory added to tcmalloc
	    * Exposed more tweaking knobs via environment variables
	    (see docs)
	    * pprof tries harder to map addresses to functions
	    * tcmalloc_minimal compiles and runs on FreeBSD 6.0 and
	    Solaris 10
	    *** INTERNAL CHANGES:
	    * Much better 64-bit support
	    * Better multiple-processor support (e.g. multicore contention
	    tweaks)
	    * Support for recent kernel ABI changes (e.g. new arg
	    to mremap)
	    * Addition of spinlocks to tcmalloc to reduce contention cost
	    * Speed up tcmalloc by using __thread on systems that
	    support TLS
	    * Total redesign of heap-checker to improve liveness checking
	    * More portable stack-frame analysis -- no more hard-coded
	    constants!
	    * Disentangled heap-profiler code and heap-checker code
	    * Several new unittests to test, e.g., thread-contention costs
	    * Lots of small (but important!) bug fixes: e.g., fixing
	    GetPC on amd64
	    *** KNOWN PROBLEMS:
	    * CPU-profiling may crash on x86_64 (64-bit) systems.
	    See the README
	    * Profiling/heap-checking may deadlock on x86_64 systems.
	    See README

	    * Decrease fragmentation in tcmalloc (lefevere)
	    * Support for ARM in some of the thread-specific code (markus)
	    * Turn off heap-checker for statically-linked binaries, which
	      cause error leak reports now (etune)
	    * Many pprof improvements, including a command-line interface
	    (jeff)
	    * CPU profiling now automatically affects all threads in
	    linux 2.6.
	      (Kernel bugs break CPU profiling and threads in linux 2.4
	      a bit.)
	      ProfilerEnable() and ProfilerDisable() are deprecated.
	      (sanjay)
	    * tcmalloc now correctly intercepts memalign (m3b, maxim)
	    * Syntax fix: added missing va_end()s.  Helps non-gcc
	    compiling (etune)
	    * Fixed a few coredumper bugs: race condition after
	    PTRACE_DETACH,
	      ignore non-aligned stackframe pointers (markus, menage)
	    * 64-bit cleanup, especially for spinlock code (etune)
	    and mmap (sanjay)
	    * Better support for finding threads in linux (markus)
	    * tcmalloc now tracks those stack traces that allocate memory
	    (sanjay)
	    * Work around a weird setspecific problem (sanjay)
	    * Fix tcmalloc overflow problems when an alloc is close to
	    2G/4G (sanjay)
