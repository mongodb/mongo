To build the Intel(R) Decimal Floating-Point Math Library v2.0
(conforming to the IEEE Standard 754-2008 for Floating-Point Arithmetic) 
on processors that are implementations of the IA-32 Architecture, Intel(R) 64, 
or IA-64 Architecture:

  In Linux* with icc (Intel(R) Compiler 9.1 or newer) or gcc:

    make clean  
    make CC=icc CALL_BY_REF=0 GLOBAL_RND=0 GLOBAL_FLAGS=0 UNCHANGED_BINARY_FLAGS=0
      - CC can be icc, gcc
      - CALL_BY_REF, GLOBAL_RND, GLOBAL_FLAGS, UNCHANGED_BINARY_FLAGS can be any of 0000, 0001, ... , 1111

  Big-endian builds require some additional command line parameters (see the
  following files for examples: solarisbuild, hpuxbuild*)
 
  In Windows** with icl (Intel(R) C++ Compiler 9.1 or newer) or cl (Microsoft
  Visual C++ Compiler**):

    nmake clean 
    nmake -fmakefile.mak CC=icl CALL_BY_REF=0 GLOBAL_RND=0 GLOBAL_FLAGS=0 UNCHANGED_BINARY_FLAGS=0
      -  CC can be cl, icl
      -  CALL_BY_REF, GLOBAL_RND, GLOBAL_FLAGS, UNCHANGED_BINARY_FLAGS can be any of 0000, 0001, ... , 1111
      -  [g]make, which stands for a GNU make-compatible make program (e.g. make from
         cygwin) may also be used
    
    Note: The scripts and makefiles provided here may need adjustments, 
        depending on the environment in which they are used; for example if 
        moving files from Windows to Linux, running dos2unix on the Linux 
        script files may be necessary.

     The makefiles currently support these environments, but can be extended to 
  support additional ones (such as a new Cygwin release):  Linux, FreeBSD,  
  Darwin, SunOS, HP-UX, Windows_NT, CYGWIN_NT-5.1, CYGWIN_NT-5.2-WOW64, 
  CYGWIN_NT-6.1-WOW64.
  See makefile.iml_head (line 330) for more information.

Note:
=====
  For some other operating systems and architecture combinations see the
  following command files, as well as any command files invoked from these ones:
        RUNLINUX
        RUNWINDOWS_nmake.bat
        RUNWINDOWSINTEL64.bat (for IA-64 Architecture)
        RUNOSX
        RUNOSXINTEL64 (for IA-64) Architecture
        RUNSOLARIS
        RUNHPUX32 (for HP-UX* on IA-64 Architecture, 32-bit data mode)
        RUNHPUX64 (for HP-UX* on IA-64 Architecture, 64-bit data mode)
  These command files build the Intel(R) Decimal Floating-Point Math Library,
  possibly using more than one compiler. Changes may be necessary in certain
  environments. Note that all the necessary versions of the Intel(R) Decimal 
  Floating-Point Math Library have to be built in this directory prior to
  executing the similar RUN* command in either of ../LIBRARY/ or ../TESTS/.
  Check that all the expected *.a files (or *.lib in Windows) have been created
  prior to building and running the tests or examples from ../LIBRARY/ or 
  ../TESTS/.

Note:
=====
If the makefile provided here is not used, the parameter passing method and 
local/global rounding mode and status flags may be selected by editing 
bid_conf.h:
 
Parameter passing is determined by an environment variable in bid_conf.h:
  - by value:
        #define DECIMAL_CALL_BY_REFERENCE 0
  - by reference:
        #define DECIMAL_CALL_BY_REFERENCE 1
 
Global variables are determined by two environment variables in bid_conf.h:
  - rnd_mode passed as parameter
        #define DECIMAL_GLOBAL_ROUNDING 0
  - rnd_mode global
        #define DECIMAL_GLOBAL_ROUNDING 1
  - status flags *pfpsf passed as parameter
        #define DECIMAL_GLOBAL_EXCEPTION_FLAGS 0
  - status flags *pfpsf global
        #define DECIMAL_GLOBAL_EXCEPTION_FLAGS 1
