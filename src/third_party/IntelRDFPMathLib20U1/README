  1. INTRODUCTION
  ===============

  This package contains the release 2.0 of the Intel(R) Decimal
Floating-Point Math Library, conforming to the IEEE Standard 754-2008 for
Floating-Point Arithmetic. This is an extension of Release 1.0 of 2009.

  The library implements the functions defined for decimal floating-point
arithmetic operations in the IEEE Standard 754-2008 for Floating-Point
Arithmetic, which is a revision of the IEEE Standard 754-1985 for Binary
Floating-Point Arithmetic.

The IEEE Standard 754-2008 for Floating-Point Arithmetic supports two
encoding formats: the decimal encoding format, and the binary encoding format.
The Intel(R) Decimal Floating-Point Math Library supports primarily the binary
encoding format for decimal floating-point values, but the decimal encoding
format is supported too in the library, by means of conversion functions
between the two encoding formats.

  Release 2.0 of the library contained in this package implements all
the operations mandated by the IEEE Standard 754-2008. Alternate exception
handling (not a mandatory feature) is not supported currently in the library,
but the design facilitates adding it in the future. It is worth noting that
several useful functions (not part of the IEEE 754-2008 definition) are
provided in LIBRARY/bid_round.c. They can be used to round a q-digit decimal
integer number represented in binary to q - x digits (1 <= x <= q - 1).

  For operations involving integer operands or results, the library supports
signed and unsigned 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-bit integers.

  Release 2.0 adds transcendental functions (supported in 128-bit, 64-bit, 
and 32-bit decimal formats), including the ones specified in the technical 
report on decimal arithmetic ISO/IEC TR 24732 (available from www.iso.org).


  2. PACKAGE CONTENTS
  ===================

  This package contains:

  - eula.txt, a copy of the end user license agreement that applies to
    everything in this package

  - this README FILE

  - the LIBRARY subdirectory with all the source files necessary to build the
    library, and a README file which specifies how to build the library
    in Linux**, HP-UX**, Windows***, and other operating systems; a small set
    of command files (RUNLINUX, RUNWINDOWS, etc.) can be used to build the
    library with different options

  - the TESTS subdirectory with source and input files necessary to build and
    run a reduced set of tests for the library, and a README
    file which specifies how to build and run these tests;
    the test program will print the number of errors detected;
    note that tests involving 80-bit binary floating-point values (these are
    only conversions to and from decimal floating-point formats) are skipped
    if the 80-bit floating-point data type is not supported; a small set
    of command files (RUNLINUX, RUNWINDOWS, etc.) can be used to build and
    run the tests with different options

  - the EXAMPLES subdirectory containing eight examples of calls to library
    functions with various combinations of build options (see Section 8
    below); a README file is included; a small set of command files (RUNLINUX,
    RUNWINDOWS, etc.) can be used to build and run the examples with different
    options

  3. FUNCTION NAMES
  =================

  The function names used in the library are not identical to the names from
the IEEE Standard 754-2008 for Floating-Point Arithmetic. The mapping between
the two sets is given in Section 10 below. The function names can be changed
by editing the #define statements at the beginning of bid_conf.h.


  4. LIBRARY BUILD OPTIONS
  ========================

  The API for the library functions is intended to support constant modes,
global dynamic modes, and scoped dynamic modes. It should be convenient for
compilers with various requirements, even where default modes and no flag
tests can be assumed, as in C99 FENV_ACCESS OFF.

  Three build options are provided, that can be set by editing
LIBRARY/bid_conf.h, or (more conveniently) can be set on the compile
command line.

  (a) Function arguments and return values can be passed by reference if
DECIMAL_CALL_BY_REFERENCE is set to 1, or by value otherwise. However, the
floating-point status flags argument is passed by reference even when
DECIMAL_CALL_BY_REFERENCE is 0, unless it is stored in a global variable
(see (c) below).

  (b) The value of the rounding mode can be passed by reference or by value,
or it can be stored in a global variable if DECIMAL_GLOBAL_ROUNDING is
set to 1.
  If DECIMAL_GLOBAL_ROUNDING is set to 1 then the rounding mode is stored
in a global variable that must be declared as

        _IDEC_round __bid_IDEC_glbround;

In this case __bid_IDEC_glbround is a fixed name that *must* be used (but
it can be changed by editing the corresponding #define in bid_conf.h).  Its
initial value should be ROUNDING_TO_NEAREST (or an equivalent value with a name
chosen by the user, as shown in code samples from EXAMPLES where
_IDEC_nearesteven is used). The _IDEC_round type name can be different
(but equivalent), chosen by the user.

  (c) The value of the exception status flags is passed by reference if
they are not represented by a global variable, or it can be stored in a
global variable if DECIMAL_GLOBAL_EXCEPTION_FLAGS is set to 1.
  If DECIMAL_GLOBAL_EXCEPTION_FLAGS is set to 1 then the exception status
flags are stored in a global variable that must be declared as

        _IDEC_flags __bid_IDEC_glbflags;

In this case __bid_IDEC_glbflags is a fixed name that *must* be used but
it can be changed by editing the corresponding #define in bid_conf.h). Its
initial value should be EXACT_STATUS (or an equivalent value with a name chosen
by the user, as shown in code samples from EXAMPLES where _IDEC_allflagsclear
is used). The _IDEC_flags type name can be different (but equivalent),
chosen by the user.

  The three build options supported in this release are selected on the
'make' command line when building the library in LIBRARY and the tests in
TESTS using the makefile-s provided here (so editing bid_conf.h is not
necessary). For example when using the Intel(R) C++ Compiler in Linux**:

    make CC=icc CALL_BY_REF=0 GLOBAL_RND=0 GLOBAL_FLAGS=0 UNCHANGED_BINARY_FLAGS=0

selects parameter passing by value; the rounding mode is a parameter
passed to each function that requires it; the status flags are passed
as a parameter to functions that may modify them (note however that the
status flags represent an exception in that the CALL_BY_REF setting
is ignored - if not global, they are always passed by reference); the
decimal operations may change the inexact binary status flag.

  Another example, when using the Intel(R) C++ Compiler in Windows*** is:

    nmake -fmakefile.mak CC=icl CALL_BY_REF=1 GLOBAL_RND=1 GLOBAL_FLAGS=1 UNCHANGED_BINARY_FLAGS=1

where parameters are passed by reference; the rounding mode is a global
variable; the status flags are stored in a global variable; the
decimal operations will not change the inexact binary status flag.


  5. FUNCTION PROTOTYPES
  ======================

  Function prototypes are provided in LIBRARY/bid_functions.h (starting at
line 396 if parameters are passed by reference, and at line 2981 if they
are passed by value).


  6. TESTING
  ==========

  The library was tested on several different platforms (IA-32 Architecture, 
Intel(R) 64, and IA-64 Architecture running Linux**, Windows***, HP-UX**, 
Solaris**, and OSX**).  For example in Linux** icc (Intel(R) C++ Compiler 9.1 
or newer) and gcc** were used. In Windows*** icl (Intel(R) C++ Compiler 9.1 
or newer) and cl (Microsoft*** Visual C++ Compiler) were used. For each of 
these combinations eight combinations of parameter passing method and global 
or local rounding mode and status flags were tested.

  In limited situations, it is possible for incorrect compiler behavior to 
lead to incorrect results in the Intel(r) Decimal Floating-Point Math Library. 
For example, results of round-to-integer functions are incorrect when the 
library is built using gcc 4.2/4.3. Also, some gcc versions in an IA-32 
Linux environment cause slightly incorrect results in a few corner cases for 
the 64-bit decimal square root. (This is not an exhaustive list.)



  7. CHANGES SINCE THE V1.0 UPDATE 1 RELEASE
  ==========================================

  Support was added for decimal transcendental functions (see Section 11 
for details).  A small number of non-critical bugs were fixed.


  8. USAGE EXAMPLES
  =================

  Eight usage examples are given in the EXAMPLES subdirectory, which illustrate
calls to library functions with various combinations of build options (see
Section 4 above). A README file is included. Note that these examples do not
use any include files from the library: the necessary data types are defined
instead directly in the user-defined decimal.h. However, if the rounding mode
or exception status flags are stored in global variables, then these must have
the fixed names of _IDEC_glbround and _IDEC_glbflags.
  Alternatively - and this is the preferred method, one could use the data
types defined in the library by including two header files (and in this case
DECIMAL_CALL_BY_REFERENCE, DECIMAL_GLOBAL_ROUNDING, and
DECIMAL_GLOBAL_EXCEPTION_FLAGS would have to be properly defined not only when
building the library, but also for the application calling the library
functions):

        #include "../LIBRARY/bid_conf.h"
        #include "../LIBRARY/bid_functions.h"

Such an example is represented by the readtest program in TESTS/readtest.c.

  9. DECIMAL AND BINARY STATUS FLAGS
  ==================================

  The IEEE Standard 754-2008 specifies distinct rounding modes for binary
and for decimal floating-point operations. However, the floating-point status
flags may be identical for decimal and binary computations. In this
implementation of the decimal arithmetic, the decimal floating-point status
flags are kept separate from the binary flags. Still, it is possible to merge
the two sets (outside the library).
  One issue that needs to be pointed out is that the current implementation of
the decimal floating-point library may set the binary inexact status flag for
certain operations: division, square root, and several other operations where
integers are converted to floating-point values, and the conversion
is inexact. In order to avoid setting the binary inexact flag by decimal
functions, uncomment the following line in bid_conf.h
prior to building the library:
        // #define UNCHANGED_BINARY_STATUS_FLAGS

  10. MAPPING OF IEEE 754-2008 NAMES TO INTEL (R) DECIMAL FLOATING-POINT MATH
                          LIBRARY FUNCTION NAMES
  =========================================================================

Operand and result types are included, where:
        BID64 =  the 64-bit decimal floating-point format using the binary
            encoding; this becomes BID_UINT64 in the library
        BID128 =  the 128-bit decimal floating-point format using the binary
            encoding ; this becomes BID_UINT128 in the library
        binary32 = 32-bit binary floating-point data format
        binary64 = 64-bit binary floating-point data format
        binary80 = 80-bit binary floating-point data format
        binary128 = 128-bit binary floating-point data format
        string = char *
        boolean = int
        enum = int
        _IDEC_flags = int
        _IDEC_round = int

The library function names shown here can be changed by editing #define
statements in bid_conf.h.

  11. DESCRIPTION OF THE INTEL(R) DECIMAL FP MATH LIBRARY FUNCTIONS

This section gives brief descriptions of the functions available in the
Intel(R) Decimal Floating-Point Math Library v2.0. The prototypes are
shown assuming all arguments are passed by value, the rounding mode variable is
passed as an argument to each function that requires it, a pointer to a
variable containing the status flags is passed to each function that requires
it, and alternate exception handling is not supported. The function prototypes
for other variants allowed for building the library can be determined from
header files bid_functions.h and bid_conf.h, which contain also all the type
definitions used in the following description, as well as the possible values of
the rounding mode variable rnd_mode and the positions of the individual status
flags in the status word *pfpsf.
Notes:
 1. Three decimal floating-point formats are supported, as defined in
    IEEE Standard 754-2008: 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit.
    The data types used in the library for entities in the three formats are
    UINT32, UINT64, and UINT128 which can be mapped externally to types of
    appropriate sizes and alignments but having different names, for example
    _Decimal32, _Decimal64, and _Decimal128.
    The maximum number of decimal digits in the significand of numerical
    values represented in these three formats are:
      P = 7 decimal digits for the 32-bit decimal floating-point format
      P = 16 decimal digits for the 64-bit decimal floating-point format
      P = 34 decimal digits for the 128-bit decimal floating-point format
    The ranges for normal decimal floating-point numbers are (in magnitude):
      1.000000 * 10^(-95) <= x <= 9.999999 * 10^96 for 32-bit format
      1.0...0 * 10^(-383) <= x <= 9.9...9 * 10^384 for 64-bit format
            (15 decimal digits in the fractional part of the significand)
      1.0...0 * 10^(-6143) <= x <= 9.9...9 * 10^6144 for 128-bit format
            (33 decimal digits in the fractional part of the significand)
    The ranges for subnormal decimal floating-point numbers are (in magnitude):
      0.000001 * 10^(-95) <= x <= 0.999999 * 10^(-95) for 32-bit format
      0.0...01 * 10^(-383) <= x <= 0.9...9 * 10^(-383) for 64-bit format
            (15 decimal digits in the fractional part of the significand)
      0.0...01 * 10^(-6144) <= x <= 0.9...9 * 10^(-6144) for 128-bit format
            (33 decimal digits in the fractional part of the significand)
    Operations with decimal floating-point results usually choose one
    representation of the result from among several possible that have the
    same numerical value (constituting a 'cohort'). The chosen representation
    must have the 'preferred exponent' specified in the IEEE Standard 754-2008.
    (For example 1.0 * 10^(-2) + 10.0 * 10^(-3) = 20.0 * 10^(-3), and not
    2.0 * 10^(-2).)
    The encoding methods for decimal floating-point values are not explained
    here. Decimal floating-point values can be encoded using the
    string-to-decimal conversion functions (__bid64_from_string and
    __bid128_from_string), or decoded using the decimal-to-string conversion
    functions (__bid64_to_string and __bid128_to_string).
 2. The acronym 'dpd' or 'DPD' is used to identify the decimal encoding method
    for decimal floating-point values, defined in the IEEE Standard 754-2008.
    The acronym 'bid' or 'BID' is used to identify the binary encoding method
    for decimal floating-point values, defined in the IEEE Standard 754-2008.
 3. The library functions that operate on decimal floating-point values do so on
    values encoded in BID format.
 4. The floating-point status flags for inexact result, underflow, overflow,
    division by zero and invalid operation are denoted by P, U, O, Z, I
    respectively

Note that function names can be changed by editing #define statements in
bid_conf.h.

Functions Added in Release 2.0
____________________________________________

The functions listed below are described in ISO/IEC TR 24732 (a proposed 
extension to the ISO C99 standard).  They are also implemented in the Intel(R) 
Decimal Floating-Point Math Library.  
In general, the maximum ulp error was estimated mathematically to be:
    - below 1 ulp for 32-bit functions
    - below 2 ulps for 64-bit functions
    - below 8 ulps for 128-bit functions
Testing for hundreds of millions of points did not contradict these values. 
A few exceptions exist (notably for the gamma function family):
    - the 32-bit atanh, with measured errors of less than 6 ulps 
    - the 64-bit acosh and atanh, with measured errors of less than 6 ulps
    - the 128-bit sinh, cosh, and erfc, with measured errors of less than 9 ulps
    - the 128-bit tgamma and lgamma functions, whose last 5 digits of the 
      34-digit significand in the result are not reliable
As with the rest of the library, these functions can be built to use a global 
rounding mode and/or global decimal status flags.  Alternatively, they can be 
built to take the rounding mode and a pointer to the status flags as arguments 
(as seen for the functions described in the previous section).
Depending on how the library is built, the arguments and result can be passed 
by value or by reference.

The names used by the implementation differ from the names listed in ISO/IEC 
TR 24732; they are given below (as C comments).   However, the user may easily 
redefine these names by editing the #define statements at the beginning of 
bid_conf.h. 

Below, _Decimal64 stands for BID64;  _Decimal32 stands for BID32 and _Decimal128 
stands for BID128.

Calling Transcendental Functions
_________________________________

Transcendental function prototypes are similar to those of the basic decimal
functions, so they are called in a similar manner.
All function prototypes can be found in bid_functions.h.

As an example, consider the following code from bid_functions.h (also consult
bid_conf.h, where the user can rename functions via #define directives):
#if DECIMAL_CALL_BY_REFERENCE
....
     BID_EXTERN_C void bid64_exp (BID_UINT64 * pres, BID_UINT64 * px
                            _RND_MODE_PARAM _EXC_FLAGS_PARAM
                            _EXC_MASKS_PARAM _EXC_INFO_PARAM);
....
     BID_EXTERN_C void bid128_pow (BID_UINT128 * pres, BID_UINT128 * px, BID_UINT128 * py
                            _RND_MODE_PARAM _EXC_FLAGS_PARAM
                            _EXC_MASKS_PARAM _EXC_INFO_PARAM);
....
#else
....
     BID_EXTERN_C BID_UINT64 bid64_exp (BID_UINT64 x
                              _RND_MODE_PARAM _EXC_FLAGS_PARAM
                              _EXC_MASKS_PARAM _EXC_INFO_PARAM);
....
     BID_EXTERN_C BID_UINT128 bid128_pow (BID_UINT128 x, BID_UINT128 y
                              _RND_MODE_PARAM _EXC_FLAGS_PARAM
                              _EXC_MASKS_PARAM _EXC_INFO_PARAM);
....
#endif

Consider also the following code from bid_conf.h:
....  #define bid64_exp         __bid64_exp
....
#define bid128_pow        __bid128_pow
...

The code examples provided with this package (in the EXAMPLES directory) 
show how to call __bid128_mul(), and can be followed for transcendental 
functions as well.

Here are two simple examples, to compute z=bid128_pow(x,y) and b=bid64_exp(a):

  Decimal128 x, y, z;
  Decimal64 a, b;

  // The user must initialize input arguments x, y, a

  // Call sequences, assuming the library is built using:
  //  DECIMAL_CALL_BY_REFERENCE=1 (arguments passed by reference) 
  //  DECIMAL_GLOBAL_ROUNDING=0 (rounding mode passed as argument to function)
  //  DECIMAL_GLOBAL_EXCEPTION_FLAGS=0 (status flags passed as argument)
  // Need to declare and initialize rounding mode and status flags variables
  _IDEC_round my_rnd_mode = _IDEC_dflround;
  _IDEC_flags my_fpsf = _IDEC_allflagsclear;
  .....
  __bid128_pow (&z, &x, &y, &my_rnd_mode, &my_fpsf);
  __bid64_exp (&b, &a, &my_rnd_mode, &my_fpsf);

  // Call sequences, assuming the library is built using:
  //  DECIMAL_CALL_BY_REFERENCE=0 (arguments passed by value) 
  //  DECIMAL_GLOBAL_ROUNDING=1 (rounding mode stored in global variable)
  //  DECIMAL_GLOBAL_EXCEPTION_FLAGS=1 (status flags stored in global variable)
  z = __bid128_pow (x, y);
  b = __bid64_exp (a);

  For more details, including how to access the global rounding mode and 
status flags variables and how to call decimal functions when the library is 
built using any of the 8 combinations specified by DECIMAL_CALL_BY_REFERENCE, 
DECIMAL_GLOBAL_ROUNDING, and DECIMAL_GLOBAL_EXCEPTION_FLAGS, please see the 
EXAMPLES directory.

Note 1:
=======
  Functions operating on the BID32 format are implemented, but some are not 
  listed here (for example bid32_add). See the prototypes in 
  LIBRARY/bid_functions.h for a complete list of the library functions.

Note 2:
=======
  UNCHANGED_BINARY_STATUS_FLAGS allows for prevention of binary flag pollution
