# Security Policy

We take security seriously and I'm grateful for reports of security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If the vulnerability can be reported without revealing exploitable specifics, please open an issue.

If the vulnerability can't be reported publicly without leaving an obvious exploit in the public eye please email me
at jeremy@rifkin.dev or reach out to me on [discord](https://discord.gg/7kv5AuCndG).

I will do my best to get back to you within a day.
