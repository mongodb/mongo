# v1.0.3

Added:
- Added line indicator to make source code snippets in case colors aren't being used
- Added column indicator to source code snippets
- Added 32-bit ARM support for StackWalk64 https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/pull/271 (@Xottab-DUTY)

# v1.0.2

Added:
- Added `break_before_filename` formatting option https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/259 (@codeinred)

Fixes:
- Fixed 32-bit clang-cl build
- Fixed build on gcc 4.8.5
- Fixed StackWalk64 for 64-bit arm https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/pull/270 (@mcourteaux)
- Fixed compatibility issue with cmake versions before 3.23

Other:
- Added a couple notes to the README

# v1.0.1

Added:
- Added from-current-exception utility for SEH on windows (`CPPTRACE_SEH_TRY`/`CPPTRACE_SEH_EXCEPT`)

Fixes:
- Fixed a static assert without a message causing issues on some C++11 builds
- Fixed build 32-bit build on linux
- Fixed from-current-exception system for 32-bit windows where SEH behaves much differently
- Fixed clang-cl build

# v1.0.0

Major changes:
- Overhauled how the from-current-exception system and `CPPTRACE_TRY`/`CPPTRACE_CATCH` macros work. They now check the
  thrown exception type against the type the catch accepts to decide whether or not to collect a trace. This eliminates
  the need for The `TRYZ`/`CATCHZ` variants of the macros as now the normal macro is equally zero-overhead. As such, the
  `Z` variants have been removed.

Breaking changes:
- `CPPTRACE_TRYZ` and `CPPTRACE_CATCHZ` have been removed, change uses to `CPPTRACE_TRY`/`CPPTRACE_CATCH`
- `CPPTRACE_TRY`/`CPPTRACE_CATCH` macros no longer support multiple handlers and `CPPTRACE_CATCH_ALT` has been removed.
  Instead, use `cpptrace::try_catch`.
  > **Details**

  > Author's note: I apologize for this non-trivial breaking change, however, it allows for a much improved

Potentially-breaking changes:
- This version of cpptrace reworks the public interface to use an inline ABI versioning namespace. All symbols in the
  public interface are now secretly in the `cpptrace::v1` namespace. This is an ABI break, but any ABI mismatch will
  result in linker errors instead of silent bugs. This change is an effort to allow future evolution of cpptrace in a
  way that respects ABI.
- This version fixes a problem with returns from `CPPTRACE_TRY` blocks on windows. Unfortunately, this macro has to use
  an IILE on windows and as such `return` statements won't properly return from the enclosing function. This was a
  footgun and now `return` statements in `CPPTRACE_TRY` blocks are prevented from compiling on windows.

Added
- Added `cpptrace::try_catch` for handling multiple alternatives with access to current exception traces
- Added `cpptrace::rethrow` utility for rethrowing exceptions from `CPPTRACE_CATCH` while preserving the stacktrace https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/214
- Added utilities for getting the current trace from the last rethrow point
  (`cpptrace::raw_trace_from_current_exception_rethrow`, `cpptrace::from_current_exception_rethrow`,
  `cpptrace::current_exception_was_rethrown`)
- Added a logger system to allow cpptrace to report errors in a configurable manner. By default, cpptrace doesn't log
  anything. The following functions can be used to change this: (`cpptrace::set_log_level`,
  `cpptrace::set_log_callback`, and `cpptrace::use_default_stderr_logger`)
- Added `cpptrace::basename` utility
- Added `cpptrace::prettify_type` utility
- Added `cpptrace::prune_symbol` utility
- Added formatter option for symbol formatting (`cpptrace::formatter::symbols`)
- Added `cpptrace::detail::lazy_trace_holder::is_resolved`
- Added support for C++20 modules https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/pull/248
- Added `cpptrace::load_symbols_for_file` to support DLLs loaded at runtime when using dbghelp https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/pull/247

Removed
- Removed `CPPTRACE_TRYZ` and `CPPTRACE_CATCHZ` macros
- Removed the `CPPTRACE_CATCH_ALT` macro

Fixed
- Fixed a problem where `CPPTRACE_TRY` blocks could contain `return` statements but not return on windows due to an IILE. This is now an error. https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/245
- Fixed cases where cpptrace could print to stderr on internal errors without the user desiring so https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/234
- Fixed a couple internal locking mistakes
- Fixed a couple of code paths that could be susceptible to static init order issues
- Fixed bug with loading elf symbol tables that contain zero-sized entries
- Fixed an incorrect assertion regarding looking up symbols at program counters that reside before any seen subprogram DIE https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/250
- Fixed issue with `cpptrace::stacktrace::to_string()` ending with a newline on empty traces

Other
- Marked some paths in `CPPTRACE_CATCH` and `CPPTRACE_CATCHZ` as unreachable to improve usability in cases where the
  compiler may warn about missing returns.
- Improved resilience to libdwarf errors https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/pull/251
- Removed internal use of `std::is_trivial` which is deprecated in C++26 https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/236
- Bumped libdwarf to 2.0.0
- Added `--address` flag for internal symbol table tool
- Various internal work to improve the codebase and reduce complexity

# v0.8.2

Fixed:
- Fixed printing of internal error messages when an object file can't be loaded, mainly affecting MacOS https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/217

Other:
- Bumped zstd via FetchContent to 1.5.7

# v0.8.1

Fixed:
- Fixed compile error on msvc https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/215

Added:
- Added `cpptrace::can_get_safe_object_frame()`

Breaking changes:
- Renamed ctrace's `can_signal_safe_unwind` to `ctrace_can_signal_safe_unwind`. This was an oversight. Apologies for
  including a breaking change in a patch release. Github code search suggests this API isn't used in public code, at
  least.

Other:
- Added CI workflow to test on old msvc
- Made some internal improvements on robustness and cleanliness

# v0.8.0

Added:
- Added support for resolving symbols from elf and mach-o symbol tables, allowing function names to be resolved even in
  a build that doesn't include debug information https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/201
- Added a configurable stack trace formatter https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/164
- Added configuration options for the libdwarf back-end that can be used to lower memory usage on memory-constrained
  systems https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/193
- Added `cpptrace::nullable<T>::null_value`
- Made `cpptrace::nullable<T>` member functions conditionally `constexpr` where possible

Fixed:
- Fixed handling of `SymInitialize` when other code has already called `SymInitialize`. `SymInitialize` must only be
  called once per handle and cpptrace now attempts to duplicate the current process handle to avoid conflicts.
  https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/issues/204
- Fixed a couple of locking edge cases surrounding dbghelp functions
- Fixed improper deallocation of `dwarf_errmsg` in the libdwarf back-end

Breaking changes:
- `cpptrace::get_snippet` previously included a newline at the end but it now does not. This also affects the behavior
  of trace formatting with snippets enabled.

- Improved implementation and organization of internal utility types, such as `optional` and `Result`
- Improved trace printing and formatting implementation

- Added a small handful of utility tool programs that are useful for continued development, maintenance, and debugging
- Improved library CI setup
- Marked the `CPPTRACE_BUILD_BENCHMARK` option as advanced
