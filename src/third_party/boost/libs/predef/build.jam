This B2 project provides support for using the Predef library externally as
a standalone project or by embedding in your B2 project tree. To use
externally you would need a `use-project` declaration and to use the
project as a dependency where needed:

----
use-project /hash-predef : /path/to/hash-predef/root ;

exe my_thing : main.cpp : <dependency>/hash-predef ;
----

To use in your project tree you would only need to place the Predef tree
in a subdirectory and reference the project location as a dependency where
needed.

----
exe my_thin : main.cpp : <dependency>libs/hash-predef ;
----
