	* Added changelog
	* bugfix: corrected a big number of warnings coming from stray typedefs. Other
		similar issues may be present that are not triggered by the unit tests
	* bugfix: Corrected the banded matrix bug (https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7549) 
		and updated appropriate unit tests. To enable the old (incorrect though) 
		behaviour one should define BOOST_UBLAS_LEGACY_BANDED.
