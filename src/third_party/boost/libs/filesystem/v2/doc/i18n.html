<h2><a name="Internationalization">Internationalization</a></h2>
<p>Cass templates <i>basic_path</i>, <i>basic_filesystem_error</i>, and <i>
basic_directory_iterator</i> provide the basic mechanisms for 
internationalization, in ways very similar to the C++ Standard Library's <i>
basic_string</i> and similar class templates. The following typedefs are also 
provided:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>typedef basic_path&lt;std::string, ...&gt; path;
typedef basic_path&lt;std::wstring, ...&gt; wpath;

typedef basic_filesystem_error&lt;path&gt; filesystem_error;
typedef basic_filesystem_error&lt;wpath&gt; wfilesystem_error;

typedef basic_directory_iterator&lt;path&gt; directory_iterator;
typedef basic_directory_iterator&lt;wpath&gt; wdirectory_iterator;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The string type used by Boost.Filesystem <i>basic_path</i> (std::string, 
std::wstring, or whatever) is called the <i>internal</i> string type. The string 
type used by the operating system for paths (often char*, sometimes wchar_t*) is 
called the <i>external</i> string type. Conversion between internal and external 
types is performed by path traits classes. The specific conversions for <i>path</i> 
and <i>wpath</i> is implementation defined, with normative encouragement to use 
the operating system's preferred file system encoding. For many modern POSIX-based 
file systems the <i>wpath</i> external encoding is <a href="design.htm#Kuhn">
UTF-8</a>, while for modern Windows file systems such as NTFS it is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16">UTF-16</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="reference.html#Operations-functions">operational functions</a> in
<a href="../../../../boost/filesystem/operations.hpp">operations.hpp</a> are provided with overloads for
<i>path</i>, <i>wpath</i>, and user-defined <i>basic_path</i>'s. A
<a href="reference.html#Requirements-on-implementations">&quot;do-the-right-thing&quot; rule</a> 
applies to implementations, ensuring that the correct overload will be chosen.</p>
<h2><a name="Simplification">Simplification</a> of path interface</h2>
<p>Prior versions of the library required users of class <i>path</i> to identify 
the format (native or generic) and name error-checking policy, either via a 
second constructor argument or via a default mechanism. That approach caused 
complaints, particularly from users not needing the name checking features. The 
interface has now been simplified:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The distinction between native and generic formats has been eliminated. 
  See <a href="#distinction">rationale</a>. Two argument forms of path 
  constructors are now deprecated, with the second argument having no effect. 
  These constructors are only provided to ease the transition of existing code.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Path name checking functionality has been moved out of class path and into 
  separate free-functions. This still provides name checking for those who need 
  it, but with much less impact on those who don't need it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally,
<a href="reference.html#Class-template-basic_filesystem_error">basic_filesystem_error</a> has been put 
on a diet and generally simplified.</p>
<p>Error codes have been moved to a separate library,
<a href="../../../system/doc/index.html">Boost.System</a>.</p>
<p><code>&quot;//:&quot;</code> has been introduced as a path escape prefix to identify 
native paths. Rationale: simplifies basic_path constructor interfaces, easier 
use for platforms needing explicit native format identification.</p>
<h2><a name="Rationalization">Rationalization</a> of predicate functions</h2>
<p>In discussions and bug reports on the Boost developers mailing list, it 
became obvious that Boost.Filesystem's exists(), symbolic_link_exists(), and 
is_directory() predicate functions were poorly specified. There were suggestions 
to add an is_accessible() function, but Peter Dimov argued that this amounted to 
papering over the lack of a clear specification and would likely lead to future 
problems.</p>
<p>Peter suggested that an interesting way to analyze the problem was to ask 
what the expectations were for true and false values of the various predicates. 
See the <a href="#table">table</a> below.</p>
<h3>status()</h3>
<p>As part of the predicate discussions, particularly with Rob Stewart, it 
became obvious that sometimes applications need access to raw status information 
without any possibility of an exception being thrown. The
<a href="reference.html#Status-functions">status()</a> function was added to meet this 
need. It also proved clearer to specify the semantics of predicate functions in 
terms of status().</p>
<h3><a name="is_file">is_file</a>()</h3>
<p>About the same time, Jeff Garland suggested that an
<a href="reference.html#Predicate-functions">is_file()</a> predicate would 
compliment <a href="reference.html#Predicate-functions">is_directory()</a>. In working on the analysis below, it became obvious 
that the expectations for is_file() were different from the expectations for !is_directory(), 
so is_file() was added. </p>
<h3><a name="is_other">is_other</a>()</h3>
<p>On some operating systems, it is possible to have a directory entry which is 
not for either a directory or a file. The
<a href="reference.html#Predicate-functions">is_other()</a> 
function identifies such cases.</p>
<h3>Should predicates throw on errors?</h3>
<p>Some conditions reported by operating systems as errors (see
<a href="#Footnote">footnote</a>) clearly simply indicate that the predicate is 
false, rather than indicating serious failure. But other errors represent 
serious hardware or network problems, or permissions problems.</p>
<p>Some people, particularly Rob Stewart, argue that in a function like
<a href="reference.html#Predicate-functions">is_directory()</a>, any error should simply cause the function to return false. If 
there is actually an underlying problem, it will be detected it due course when 
a directory_iterator or fstream operation is attempted.</p>
<p>That view is was rejected because of the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As a general principle, the earlier errors can be reported, the better. 
  The rationale being that it is often much cheaper to fix errors sooner rather 
  than later. I've also had a lot of negative experiences where failure to 
  detect errors early caused a lot of pain and unhappy customers. Some of these 
  were directly caused by ignoring error returns from file system operations.<br>
  &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Analysis of existing programs indicated that as much as 30% of the use of 
  a predicate was not followed by directory_iterator or fstream operations on 
  the path in question. Instead, the applications performed reporting or 
  fall-back operations that would not fail, and thus were either misleading or 
  completely wrong if the <i>false</i> return value was in fact caused by 
  hardware or network failure, or permissions problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the discussion did identify that there are valid cases where 
non-throwing behavior is a requirement, and a programmer may prefer to deal with 
file or directory attributes and errors at a very low, bit-mask, level. Function <a href="#status">status()</a> 
was proposed to meet those needs.</p>
<h3><a name="Expectations">Expectations</a> <a name="table">table</a></h3>
<p>In the table below, <i>p</i> is a non-empty path.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, all functions throw on hardware or general 
failure errors, permission or access errors, symbolic link loop errors, and 
invalid path errors. If an O/S fails to distinguish between error types, 
predicate operations return false on such ambiguous errors.</p>
<p><i><b>Expectations</b></i> identify operations that are expected to succeed 
or fail, assuming no hardware, permission, or access right errors, and no race 
conditions.</p>

<h3><a name="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>Predicate operations is_directory(), is_file(), is_symlink(), and exists() 
with the indicated semantics form a self-consistent set that meets expectations.</p>
<h2><a name="Preservation">Preservation</a> of existing user code</h2>
<p>Although the change to a template based approach required a complete overhaul 
of the implementation code, the  interface as used by existing applications is mostly unchanged. 
Conversion problems which would 
otherwise affect user code have been reduced by providing deprecated 
functions to ease transition. The deprecated functions are:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>// class basic_path - 2nd constructor argument ignored:
basic_path( const string_type &amp; str, name_check );
basic_path( const typename string_type::value_type * s, name_check );

// class basic_path - old names provided for renamed functions:
string_type native_file_string() const;
string_type native_directory_string() const;

// class basic_path - now defined such that these no longer have any real effect:
static bool default_name_check_writable() { return false; } 
static void default_name_check( name_check ) {}
static name_check default_name_check() { return 0; }

// non-deducible operations functions assume class path
inline path current_path()
inline const path &amp; initial_path()

// the new basic_directory_entry provides leaf()
// to cover the common existing use case itr-&gt;leaf()
typename Path::string_type leaf() const;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If you do not want  the deprecated functions to be included, define the macro BOOST_FILESYSTEM_NO_DEPRECATED.</p>
<p>The greatest impact on existing code is the change of directory iterator 
value type from <code>path</code> to <code>directory_entry</code>. To ease the 
most common directory iterator use case, <code>basic_directory_entry</code> 
provides an automatic conversion to <code>basic_path</code>, and this also 
serves to prevent breakage of a lot of existing code. See the
<a href="#More_efficient">next section</a> for discussion of rationale.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>// the new basic_directory_entry provides:
operator const path_type &amp;() const;</pre>
  </blockquote>
<h2><a name="More_efficient">More efficient</a> operations when iterating over 
directories</h2>
<p>Several common real-world operating systems (BSD derivatives, Linux, Windows) 
provide status information during directory iteration. Caching of this status 
information results in three to six times faster operation for typical predicate 
operations. (For a directory containing 15,047 files, iteration in 1 second vs 6 
seconds on a freshly booted system, and 0.3 seconds vs 0.9 seconds after prior use of 
the directory.</p>
<p>The efficiency gains from caching such status information were considered too 
significant to ignore. Because the possibility of race-conditions differs 
depending on whether the cached information is used or an actual system call is 
performed, it was considered necessary to provide explicit functions utilizing 
the cached information, rather than implicitly using the cache behind the 
scenes.</p>
<p>Three options were explored for exposing the cached status information, with 
full implementations of each. After initial implementation of option 1 exposed 
the problems noted below, option 2 was tested as a possible engineering 
tradeoff. Option 3 
was finally chosen as the cleanest design.</p>

<h2><a name="Rationale">Rationale</a></h2>
<h3>Elimination of the native versus generic <a name="distinction">distinction</a></h3>
<p>Elimination of user confusion and general design simplification was the 
original motivation for elimination of the distinction between native and 
generic paths.</p>
<p>During design work, a further technical argument was discovered. Consider the 
path <code>&quot;c:foo/bar&quot;</code>. On many POSIX systems, <code>&quot;c:foo&quot;</code> is a 
valid directory name, so we have a two element path and there is no issue of 
native versus generic format. On Windows system, however, <code>&quot;c:&quot;</code> is a 
drive specification, so we have a three element path. All calls to the operating 
system will result in <code>&quot;c:&quot;</code> being considered a drive specification; 
there is no way that fact-of-life can be changed by claiming the format is 
generic. The native versus generic distinction is thus useless and misleading 
for POSIX, Windows, and probably most other operating systems.</p>
<p>If paths for a particular operating system did require a distinction be made, 
it could be done by requiring that native paths be prefixed with some unique 
implementation-defined identification. For example, <code>&quot;native-path:&quot;</code>. 
This would only be required for operating systems where (1) the distinction 
mattered, and (2) there was no lexical way to distinguish the two forms. For 
example, a native operating system that used the same syntax as the Filesystem 
Library's generic POSIX-like format, but processed the elements right-to-left 
instead of left-to-right.</p>
<h3>Preservation of <a name="existing-code">existing code</a></h3>
<p>Allowing existing user code to continue to work with the updated version of 
the library has obvious benefits in terms of preserving the effort users have 
applied to both learning the library and writing code which uses the library.</p>
<p>There is an additional motivation; other than the name checking portion of 
class path,&nbsp; the existing interface has proven to be useful and robust, so 
there is no reason to fiddle with it.</p>
<h3><a name="Single_path_design">Single path design</a></h3>
<p>During preliminary internationalization discussion on the Boost developer's 
list, a design was considered for a single path class which could hold either 
narrow or wide character based paths. That design was rejected because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The design was, for many applications, an over-generalization with runtime 
  memory and speed costs which would have to be paid for even when not needed.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>There was concern that the design would be confusing to users, given that 
  the standard library already uses single-value-type strings, rather than 
  strings which morph value types as needed.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>There were technical issues with conversions when a narrow path was 
  appended to a wide path, and visa versa. The concern was that double 
  conversions could cause incorrect results, that conversions best left to the 
  operating system would be performed, and that the technical complexity was too 
  great in relation to perceived benefits. User-defined types would only make 
  the problem worse.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>No versions of <a href="reference.html#Status-functions">status()</a> which throw exceptions on 
errors</h3>
<p>The rationale for not including versions of status() 
which throw exceptions on errors is that (1) the primary purpose of this 
function is to perform queries at a very low-level, where exceptions are usually 
unwanted, and (2) exceptions on errors are already provided by the predicate 
functions. There would be little or no efficiency gain from providing a throwing 
version of status().</p>
<h3>Symlink identifying version of <a href="reference.html#Status-functions">status()</a> function</h3>
<p>A symlink identifying version of the status() function is distinguished by a 
second argument. Often separately named functions are more appropriate than 
overloading when behavior 
differs, which is the case here, while overloads are more appropriate when 
behavior is the same but argument types differ (Iain Hanson). Overloading was 
chosen in this particular case because a subjective judgment that a single 
function name with an optional &quot;symlink&quot; second argument produced more 
understandable code. The original implementation of the function used the name &quot;symlink_status&quot;, 
but that just didn't read right in real code.</p>
<h3>POSIX wpath_traits defaults to locale(&quot;&quot;), but allows imbuing of locale</h3>
<p>Vladimir Prus pointed out that for Linux (and presumably other POSIX 
operating systems) that need to convert wide character paths to narrow 
characters, the default conversion should not depend on the operating system 
alone, but on the std::locale(&quot;&quot;) default. For example, the usual encoding 
for Russian on Linux (and Russian web sites) is KOI8-R (RFC1489). The ability to safely specify a different locale 
is also provided, to meet unforeseen needs.</p>
