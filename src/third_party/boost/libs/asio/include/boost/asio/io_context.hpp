/// Provides core I/O functionality.
/**
 * The io_context class provides the core I/O functionality for users of the
 * asynchronous I/O objects, including:
 *
 * @li boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket
 * @li boost::asio::ip::tcp::acceptor
 * @li boost::asio::ip::udp::socket
 * @li boost::asio::deadline_timer.
 *
 * The io_context class also includes facilities intended for developers of
 * custom asynchronous services.
 *
 * @par Thread Safety
 * @e Distinct @e objects: Safe.@n
 * @e Shared @e objects: Safe, with the specific exceptions of the restart()
 * and notify_fork() functions. Calling restart() while there are unfinished
 * run(), run_one(), run_for(), run_until(), poll() or poll_one() calls results
 * in undefined behaviour. The notify_fork() function should not be called
 * while any io_context function, or any function on an I/O object that is
 * associated with the io_context, is being called in another thread.
 *
 * @par Concepts:
 * Dispatcher.
 *
 * @par Synchronous and asynchronous operations
 *
 * Synchronous operations on I/O objects implicitly run the io_context object
 * for an individual operation. The io_context functions run(), run_one(),
 * run_for(), run_until(), poll() or poll_one() must be called for the
 * io_context to perform asynchronous operations on behalf of a C++ program.
 * Notification that an asynchronous operation has completed is delivered by
 * invocation of the associated handler. Handlers are invoked only by a thread
 * that is currently calling any overload of run(), run_one(), run_for(),
 * run_until(), poll() or poll_one() for the io_context.
 *
 * @par Effect of exceptions thrown from handlers
 *
 * If an exception is thrown from a handler, the exception is allowed to
 * propagate through the throwing thread's invocation of run(), run_one(),
 * run_for(), run_until(), poll() or poll_one(). No other threads that are
 * calling any of these functions are affected. It is then the responsibility
 * of the application to catch the exception.
 *
 * After the exception has been caught, the run(), run_one(), run_for(),
 * run_until(), poll() or poll_one() call may be restarted @em without the need
 * for an intervening call to restart(). This allows the thread to rejoin the
 * io_context object's thread pool without impacting any other threads in the
 * pool.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * @code
 * boost::asio::io_context io_context;
 * ...
 * for (;;)
 * {
 *   try
 *   {
 *     io_context.run();
 *     break; // run() exited normally
 *   }
 *   catch (my_exception& e)
 *   {
 *     // Deal with exception as appropriate.
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Submitting arbitrary tasks to the io_context
 *
 * To submit functions to the io_context, use the @ref boost::asio::dispatch,
 * @ref boost::asio::post or @ref boost::asio::defer free functions.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * @code void my_task()
 * {
 *   ...
 * }
 *
 * ...
 *
 * boost::asio::io_context io_context;
 *
 * // Submit a function to the io_context.
 * boost::asio::post(io_context, my_task);
 *
 * // Submit a lambda object to the io_context.
 * boost::asio::post(io_context,
 *     []()
 *     {
 *       ...
 *     });
 *
 * // Run the io_context until it runs out of work.
 * io_context.run(); @endcode
 *
 * @par Stopping the io_context from running out of work
 *
 * Some applications may need to prevent an io_context object's run() call from
 * returning when there is no more work to do. For example, the io_context may
 * be being run in a background thread that is launched prior to the
 * application's asynchronous operations. The run() call may be kept running by
 * using the @ref make_work_guard function to create an object of type
 * boost::asio::executor_work_guard<io_context::executor_type>:
 *
 * @code boost::asio::io_context io_context;
 * boost::asio::executor_work_guard<boost::asio::io_context::executor_type>
 *   = boost::asio::make_work_guard(io_context);
 * ... @endcode
 *
 * To effect a shutdown, the application will then need to call the io_context
 * object's stop() member function. This will cause the io_context run() call
 * to return as soon as possible, abandoning unfinished operations and without
 * permitting ready handlers to be dispatched.
 *
 * Alternatively, if the application requires that all operations and handlers
 * be allowed to finish normally, the work object may be explicitly reset.
 *
 * @code boost::asio::io_context io_context;
 * boost::asio::executor_work_guard<boost::asio::io_context::executor_type>
 *   = boost::asio::make_work_guard(io_context);
 * ...
 * work.reset(); // Allow run() to exit. @endcode

   *
   * @li When a single connection ends, all associated asynchronous operations
   * complete. The corresponding handler objects are destroyed, and all
   * @c shared_ptr references to the objects are destroyed.
   *
   * @li To shut down the whole program, the io_context function stop() is
   * called to terminate any run() calls as soon as possible. The io_context
   * destructor defined above destroys all handlers, causing all @c shared_ptr
   * references to all connection objects to be destroyed.
