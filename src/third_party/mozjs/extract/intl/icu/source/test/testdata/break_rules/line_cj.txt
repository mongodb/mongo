# Reference Line Break rules for intltest rbbi/RBBIMonkeyTest.
# Rules derived from Unicode Standard Annex #14 Revision 44 for Unicode 13.0

# Note: Rule syntax and the monkey test itself are still a work in progress.
#       They are expected to change with review and the addition of support for rule tailoring.
