#- N.B. DO NOT put any filters, NFD, etc. here -- those are aliased in
#- the INDEX file.  This transliterator is, by itself, not
#- instantiated.  It is used as a part of Latin-Jamo, Latin-Hangul, or
#- inverses thereof.
# Transliteration from Latin characters to Korean script is done in
# two steps: Latin to Jamo, then Jamo to Hangul.  The Jamo-Hangul
# transliteration is done algorithmically following Unicode 3.0
# section 3.11.  This file implements the Latin to Jamo
# transliteration using rules.
# Jamo occupy the block 1100-11FF.  Within this block there are three
# groups of characters: initial consonants or choseong (I), medial
# vowels or jungseong (M), and trailing consonants or jongseong (F).
# Standard Korean syllables are of the form I+M+F*.
# Section 3.11 describes the use of 'filler' jamo to convert
# nonstandard syllables to standard form: the choseong filler 115F and
# the junseong filler 1160.  In this transliterator, we will not use
# 115F or 1160.
# We will, however, insert two 'null' jamo to make foreign words
# conform to Korean syllable structure.  These are the null initial
# consonant 110B (IEUNG) and the null vowel 1173 (EU).  In Latin text,
# we will use the separator in order to disambiguate strings,
# e.g. "kan-ggan" (initial GG) vs. "kanggan" (final NG + initial G).
# We will not use all of the characters in the jamo block.  We will
# only use the 19 initials, 21 medials, and 27 finals possessing a
# jamo short name as defined in section 4.4 of the Unicode book.
# Rules of thumb.  These guidelines provide the basic framework
# for the rules.  They are phrased in terms of Latin-Jamo transliteration.
# The Jamo-Latin rules derive from these, since the Jamo-Latin rules are
# just context-free transliteration of jamo to corresponding short names,
# with the addition of separators to maintain round-trip integrity
# in the context of the Latin-Jamo rules.
# A sequence of vowels:
# - Take the longest sequence you can. If there are too many, or you don't
#   have a starting consonant, introduce a 110B necessary.
# A sequence of consonants.
# - First join the double consonants: G + G -→ GG
# - In the remaining list,
# -- If there is no preceding vowel, take the first consonant, and insert EU
#    after it. Continue with the rest of the consonants.
# -- If there is one consonant, attach to the following vowel
# -- If there are two consonants and a following vowel, attach one to the
#    preceeding vowel, and one to the following vowel.
# -- If there are more than two consonants, join the first two together if you
#    can: L + G =→ LG
# -- If you still end up with more than 2 consonants, insert EU after the
#    first one, and continue with the rest of the consonants.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Jamo-Latin
#
# Jamo to latin is relatively simple, since it is the latin that is
# ambiguous.  Most rules are straightforward, and we encode them below
# as simple add-on back rule, e.g.:
#   $jamoMedial {bs} → $BS;
# becomes
#   $jamoMedial {bs} ↔ $BS;
#
# Furthermore, we don't care about the ordering for Jamo-Latin because
# we are going from single characters, so we can very easily piggyback
# on the Latin-Jamo.
#
# The main issue with Jamo-Latin is when to insert separators.
# Separators are inserted to obtain correct round trip behavior.  For
# example, the sequence Ki A Gf Gi E, if transliterated to "kagge",
# would then round trip to Ki A GGi E.  To prevent this, we insert a
# separator: "kag-ge".  IMPORTANT: The need for separators depends
# very specifically on the behavior of the Latin-Jamo rules.  A change
# in the Latin-Jamo behavior can completely change the way the
# separator insertion must be done.
# First try to preserve actual separators in the jamo text by doubling
# them.  This fixes problems like:
# (Di)(A)(Ji)(U)(NG)-(IEUNG)(YEO)(Nf)(Gi)(YEO)(L) =→ dajung-yeongyeol
# =→ (Di)(A)(Ji)(U)(NG)(IEUNG)(YEO)(Nf)(Gi)(YEO)(L).  This is optional
# -- if we don't care about losing separators in the jamo, we can delete
# this rule.
$sep $sep ↔ $sep;
# Triple consonants.  For three consonants "axxx" we insert a
# separator between the first and second "x" if XXf, Xf, and Xi all
# exist, and we have A Xf XXi.  This prevents the reverse
# transliteration to A XXf Xi.
$sep ← $latinMedialEnd s {} $SSi;
# For vowels the rule is similar.  If there is a vowel "ae" such that
# "a" by itself and "e" by itself are vowels, then we want to map A E
# to "a-e" so as not to round trip to AE.  However, in the text Ki EO
# IEUNG E we don't need to map to "keo-e".  "keoe" suffices.  For
# vowels of the form "aei", both "ae" + "i" and "a" + "ei" must be
# tested.  NOTE: These rules used to have a left context of
# $latinInitial instead of [^$latinMedial].  The problem with this is
# sequences where an initial IEUNG is transliterated away:
#   (IEUNG)(A)(IEUNG)(EO) =→ aeo =→ (IEUNG)(AE)(IEUNG)(O)
# Also problems in cases like gayeo, which needs to be gaye-o
# The hard case is a chain, like aeoeu. Normally interpreted as ae oe u. So for a-eoeu, we have to insert $sep
# But, we don't insert between the o and the e.
#
# a ae
# e eo eu
# i
# o oe
# u
# ui
# wa wae we wi
# yae ya yeo ye yo yu
# These are simple, since they can't chain. Note that we don't handle extreme cases like [ga][eo][e][o]
