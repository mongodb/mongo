# This transform converts Zawgyi "encoded" Burmese into proper
# unicode. Zawgyi is a popular encoding scheme in Myanmar. It uses
# the Myanmar unicode range but assigns different characters or
# glyphs to some codepoints. In addition to the character mapping,
# there is reordering of codepoints needed to match the expected
# unicode order. This reordering is context-based.
#
# This transform is done in two main stages:
# (1) Map all Zawgyi codepoints to their Unicode counterpart.
# (2) Perform reordering.
# Modern Burmese digits & Unicode code points.
