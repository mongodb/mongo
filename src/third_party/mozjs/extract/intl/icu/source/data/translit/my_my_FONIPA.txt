# Pronunciation rules for Burmese.
#
# The following rules are lexical and heuristic: lexical in the sense
# that they generate phoneme strings which may further undergo
# post-lexical phonological processes, in particular voicing, to
# result in actual surface forms; heuristic in the sense that they try
# to resolve ambiguities, especially around reduced vowels, in a
# systematic way that may be incorrect in many situations. Vowel
# reduction depends on many factors, such as morphemic structure,
# which are not available here.
