MFBT uses standard Mozilla style, with the following exceptions.

- Some of the files use a lower-case letter at the start of function names.
  This is because MFBT used to use a different style, and was later converted
  to standard Mozilla style. These functions have not been changed to use an
  upper-case letter because it would cause a lot of churn in other parts of the
  codebase. However, new files should follow standard Mozilla style and use an
  upper-case letter at the start of function names.

- Imported third-party code (such as decimal/*, double-conversion/source/*, and
  lz4/*) remains in its original style.
