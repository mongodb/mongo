 * and have subtly different semantics depending on their placement, the

 *
 * Attributes that apply to a struct or class precede the name of the class:
 * (Note that this is different from the placement of final for classes!)
 *
 *   class MOZ_CLASS_ATTRIBUTE SomeClass {};
 *
 * Attributes that apply to functions follow the parentheses and const
 * qualifiers but precede final, override and the function body:
 *
 *   void DeclaredFunction() MOZ_FUNCTION_ATTRIBUTE;
 *   void SomeFunction() MOZ_FUNCTION_ATTRIBUTE {}
 *   void PureFunction() const MOZ_FUNCTION_ATTRIBUTE = 0;
 *   void OverriddenFunction() MOZ_FUNCTION_ATTIRBUTE override;
 *
 * Attributes that apply to variables or parameters follow the variable's name:
 *
 *   int variable MOZ_VARIABLE_ATTRIBUTE;
 *
 * Attributes that apply to types follow the type name:
 *
 *   typedef int MOZ_TYPE_ATTRIBUTE MagicInt;
 *   int MOZ_TYPE_ATTRIBUTE someVariable;
 *   int* MOZ_TYPE_ATTRIBUTE magicPtrInt;
 *   int MOZ_TYPE_ATTRIBUTE* ptrToMagicInt;
 *
 * Attributes that apply to statements precede the statement:
 *
 *   MOZ_IF_ATTRIBUTE if (x == 0)
 *   MOZ_DO_ATTRIBUTE do { } while (0);
 *
 * Attributes that apply to labels precede the label:
 *
 *   MOZ_LABEL_ATTRIBUTE target:
 *     goto target;
 *   MOZ_CASE_ATTRIBUTE case 5:
 *   MOZ_DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTE default:
 *
 * The static analyses that are performed by the plugin are as follows:
 *
 * MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT: Applies to functions which can run script. Callers of
 *   this function must also be marked as MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT, and all refcounted
 *   arguments must be strongly held in the caller. Note that MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT
 *   should only be applied to function declarations, not definitions. If you
 *   need to apply it to a definition (eg because both are generated by a macro)
 *   use MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT_FOR_DEFINITION.
 *
 *   MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT can be applied to XPIDL-generated declarations by
 *   annotating the method or attribute as [can_run_script] in the .idl file.
 *
 * MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT_FOR_DEFINITION: Same as MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT, but usable on
 *   a definition. If the declaration is in a header file, users of that header
 *   file may not see the annotation.
 * MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT_BOUNDARY: Applies to functions which need to call
 *   MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT functions, but should not themselves be considered
 *   MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT. This should generally be avoided but can be used in
 *   two cases:
 *     1) As a temporary measure to limit the scope of changes when adding
 *        MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT.  Such a use must be accompanied by a follow-up bug
 *        to replace the MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT_BOUNDARY with MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT and
 *        a comment linking to that bug.
 *     2) If we can reason that the MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT callees of the function
 *        do not in fact run script (for example, because their behavior depends
 *        on arguments and we pass the arguments that don't allow script
 *        execution).  Such a use must be accompanied by a comment that explains
 *        why it's OK to have the MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT_BOUNDARY, as well as
 *        comments in the callee pointing out that if its behavior changes the
 *        caller might need adjusting.  And perhaps also a followup bug to
 *        refactor things so the "script" and "no script" codepaths do not share
 *        a chokepoint.
 *   Importantly, any use MUST be accompanied by a comment explaining why it's
 *   there, and should ideally have an action plan for getting rid of the
 *   MOZ_CAN_RUN_SCRIPT_BOUNDARY annotation.
 * MOZ_MUST_OVERRIDE: Applies to all C++ member functions. All immediate
 *   subclasses must provide an exact override of this method; if a subclass
 *   does not override this method, the compiler will emit an error. This
 *   attribute is not limited to virtual methods, so if it is applied to a
 *   nonvirtual method and the subclass does not provide an equivalent
 *   definition, the compiler will emit an error.
 * MOZ_STATIC_CLASS: Applies to all classes. Any class with this annotation is
 *   expected to live in static memory, so it is a compile-time error to use
 *   it, or an array of such objects, as the type of a variable declaration, or
 *   as a temporary object, or as the type of a new expression (unless
 *   placement new is being used). If a member of another class uses this
 *   class, or if another class inherits from this class, then it is considered
 *   to be a static class as well, although this attribute need not be provided
 *   in such cases.
 * MOZ_STATIC_LOCAL_CLASS: Applies to all classes. Any class with this
 *   annotation is expected to be a static local variable, so it is
 *   a compile-time error to use it, or an array of such objects, or as a
 *   temporary object, or as the type of a new expression. If another class
 *   inherits from this class then it is considered to be a static local
 *   class as well, although this attribute need not be provided in such cases.
 *   It is also a compile-time error for any class with this annotation to have
 *   a non-trivial destructor.
 * MOZ_STACK_CLASS: Applies to all classes. Any class with this annotation is
 *   expected to live on the stack, so it is a compile-time error to use it, or
 *   an array of such objects, as a global or static variable, or as the type of
 *   a new expression (unless placement new is being used). If a member of
 *   another class uses this class, or if another class inherits from this
 *   class, then it is considered to be a stack class as well, although this
 *   attribute need not be provided in such cases.
 * MOZ_NONHEAP_CLASS: Applies to all classes. Any class with this annotation is
 *   expected to live on the stack or in static storage, so it is a compile-time
 *   error to use it, or an array of such objects, as the type of a new
 *   expression. If a member of another class uses this class, or if another
 *   class inherits from this class, then it is considered to be a non-heap
 *   class as well, although this attribute need not be provided in such cases.
 * MOZ_HEAP_CLASS: Applies to all classes. Any class with this annotation is
 *   expected to live on the heap, so it is a compile-time error to use it, or

 *   temporary object. If a member of another class uses this class, or if
 *   another class inherits from this class, then it is considered to be a heap
 *   class as well, although this attribute need not be provided in such cases.
 * MOZ_NON_TEMPORARY_CLASS: Applies to all classes. Any class with this
 *   annotation is expected not to live in a temporary. If a member of another
 *   class uses this class or if another class inherits from this class, then it
 *   is considered to be a non-temporary class as well, although this attribute
 *   need not be provided in such cases.
 * MOZ_TEMPORARY_CLASS: Applies to all classes. Any class with this annotation
 *   is expected to only live in a temporary. If another class inherits from
 *   this class, then it is considered to be a temporary class as well, although
 *   this attribute need not be provided in such cases.
 * MOZ_RAII: Applies to all classes. Any class with this annotation is assumed
 *   to be a RAII guard, which is expected to live on the stack in an automatic
 *   allocation. It is prohibited from being allocated in a temporary, static
 *   storage, or on the heap. This is a combination of MOZ_STACK_CLASS and
 *   MOZ_NON_TEMPORARY_CLASS.
 * MOZ_ONLY_USED_TO_AVOID_STATIC_CONSTRUCTORS: Applies to all classes that are
 *   intended to prevent introducing static initializers.  This attribute
 *   currently makes it a compile-time error to instantiate these classes
 *   anywhere other than at the global scope, or as a static member of a class.
 *   In non-debug mode, it also prohibits non-trivial constructors and
 *   destructors.
 * MOZ_TRIVIAL_CTOR_DTOR: Applies to all classes that must have both a trivial
 *   or constexpr constructor and a trivial destructor. Setting this attribute
 *   on a class makes it a compile-time error for that class to get a
 *   non-trivial constructor or destructor for any reason.
 * MOZ_ALLOW_TEMPORARY: Applies to constructors. This indicates that using the
 *   constructor is allowed in temporary expressions, if it would have otherwise
 *   been forbidden by the type being a MOZ_NON_TEMPORARY_CLASS. Useful for
 *   constructors like Maybe(Nothing).
 * MOZ_HEAP_ALLOCATOR: Applies to any function. This indicates that the return
 *   value is allocated on the heap, and will as a result check such allocations
 *   during MOZ_STACK_CLASS and MOZ_NONHEAP_CLASS annotation checking.
 * MOZ_IMPLICIT: Applies to constructors. Implicit conversion constructors
 *   are disallowed by default unless they are marked as MOZ_IMPLICIT. This
 *   attribute must be used for constructors which intend to provide implicit
 *   conversions.
 * MOZ_IS_REFPTR: Applies to class declarations of ref pointer to mark them as
 *   such for use with static-analysis.
 *   A ref pointer is an object wrapping a pointer and automatically taking care
 *   of its refcounting upon construction/destruction/transfer of ownership.
 *   This annotation implies MOZ_IS_SMARTPTR_TO_REFCOUNTED.
 * MOZ_IS_SMARTPTR_TO_REFCOUNTED: Applies to class declarations of smart
 *   pointers to ref counted classes to mark them as such for use with
 *   static-analysis.
 * MOZ_NO_ARITHMETIC_EXPR_IN_ARGUMENT: Applies to functions. Makes it a compile
 *   time error to pass arithmetic expressions on variables to the function.
 * MOZ_OWNING_REF: Applies to declarations of pointers to reference counted
 *   types.  This attribute tells the compiler that the raw pointer is a strong
 *   reference, where ownership through methods such as AddRef and Release is
 *   managed manually.  This can make the compiler ignore these pointers when
 *   validating the usage of pointers otherwise.
 *
 *   Example uses include owned pointers inside of unions, and pointers stored
 *   in POD types where a using a smart pointer class would make the object
 *   non-POD.
 * MOZ_NON_OWNING_REF: Applies to declarations of pointers to reference counted
 *   types.  This attribute tells the compiler that the raw pointer is a weak
 *   reference, which is ensured to be valid by a guarantee that the reference
 *   will be nulled before the pointer becomes invalid.  This can make the
 *   compiler ignore these pointers when validating the usage of pointers
 *   otherwise.
 *
 *   Examples include an mOwner pointer, which is nulled by the owning class's
 *   destructor, and is null-checked before dereferencing.
 * MOZ_UNSAFE_REF: Applies to declarations of pointers to reference counted
 *   types.  Occasionally there are non-owning references which are valid, but
 *   do not take the form of a MOZ_NON_OWNING_REF.  Their safety may be
 *   dependent on the behaviour of API consumers.  The string argument passed
 *   to this macro documents the safety conditions.  This can make the compiler
 *   ignore these pointers when validating the usage of pointers elsewhere.
 *
 *   Examples include an nsAtom* member which is known at compile time to point
 *   to a static atom which is valid throughout the lifetime of the program, or
 *   an API which stores a pointer, but doesn't take ownership over it, instead
 *   requiring the API consumer to correctly null the value before it becomes
 *   invalid.
 *
 *   Use of this annotation is discouraged when a strong reference or one of
 *   the above two annotations can be used instead.
 * MOZ_NO_ADDREF_RELEASE_ON_RETURN: Applies to function declarations.  Makes it
 *   a compile time error to call AddRef or Release on the return value of a
 *   function.  This is intended to be used with operator->() of our smart
 *   pointer classes to ensure that the refcount of an object wrapped in a
 *   smart pointer is not manipulated directly.
 * MOZ_NEEDS_NO_VTABLE_TYPE: Applies to template class declarations.  Makes it
 *   a compile time error to instantiate this template with a type parameter
 *   which has a VTable.
 * MOZ_NON_MEMMOVABLE: Applies to class declarations for types that are not safe
 *   to be moved in memory using memmove().
 * MOZ_NEEDS_MEMMOVABLE_TYPE: Applies to template class declarations where the
 *   template arguments are required to be safe to move in memory using
 *   memmove().  Passing MOZ_NON_MEMMOVABLE types to these templates is a
 *   compile time error.
 * MOZ_NEEDS_MEMMOVABLE_MEMBERS: Applies to class declarations where each member
 *   must be safe to move in memory using memmove().  MOZ_NON_MEMMOVABLE types
 *   used in members of these classes are compile time errors.
 * MOZ_NO_DANGLING_ON_TEMPORARIES: Applies to method declarations which return
 *   a pointer that is freed when the destructor of the class is called. This
 *   prevents these methods from being called on temporaries of the class,
 *   reducing risks of use-after-free.
 *   This attribute cannot be applied to && methods.
 *   In some cases, adding a deleted &&-qualified overload is too restrictive as
 *   this method should still be callable as a non-escaping argument to another
 *   function. This annotation can be used in those cases.
 * MOZ_INHERIT_TYPE_ANNOTATIONS_FROM_TEMPLATE_ARGS: Applies to template class
 *   declarations where an instance of the template should be considered, for
 *   static analysis purposes, to inherit any type annotations (such as
 *   MOZ_STACK_CLASS) from its template arguments.
 * MOZ_INIT_OUTSIDE_CTOR: Applies to class member declarations. Occasionally
 *   there are class members that are not initialized in the constructor,
 *   but logic elsewhere in the class ensures they are initialized prior to use.
 *   Using this attribute on a member disables the check that this member must
 *   be initialized in constructors via list-initialization, in the constructor
 *   body, or via functions called from the constructor body.
 * MOZ_IS_CLASS_INIT: Applies to class method declarations. Occasionally the
 *   constructor doesn't initialize all of the member variables and another
 *   function is used to initialize the rest. This marker is used to make the
 *   static analysis tool aware that the marked function is part of the
 *   initialization process and to include the marked function in the scan
 *   mechanism that determines which member variables still remain
 *   uninitialized.
 * MOZ_NON_PARAM: Applies to types. Makes it compile time error to use the type
 *   in parameter without pointer or reference.
 * MOZ_NON_AUTOABLE: Applies to class declarations. Makes it a compile time
 *   error to use `auto` in place of this type in variable declarations.  This
 *   is intended to be used with types which are intended to be implicitly
 *   constructed into other other types before being assigned to variables.
 * MOZ_REQUIRED_BASE_METHOD: Applies to virtual class method declarations.
 *   Sometimes derived classes override methods that need to be called by their
 *   overridden counterparts. This marker indicates that the marked method must
 *   be called by the method that it overrides.
 * MOZ_MUST_RETURN_FROM_CALLER_IF_THIS_IS_ARG: Applies to method declarations.
 *   Callers of the annotated method must return from that function within the
 *   calling block using an explicit `return` statement if the "this" value for
 *   the call is a parameter of the caller.  Only calls to Constructors,
 *   references to local and member variables, and calls to functions or
 *   methods marked as MOZ_MAY_CALL_AFTER_MUST_RETURN may be made after the
 *   MOZ_MUST_RETURN_FROM_CALLER_IF_THIS_IS_ARG call.
 * MOZ_MAY_CALL_AFTER_MUST_RETURN: Applies to function or method declarations.
 *   Calls to these methods may be made in functions after calls a
 *   MOZ_MUST_RETURN_FROM_CALLER_IF_THIS_IS_ARG method.
 * MOZ_UNANNOTATED/MOZ_ANNOTATED: Applies to Mutexes/Monitors and variations on
 *   them. MOZ_UNANNOTATED indicates that the Mutex/Monitor/etc hasn't been
 *   examined and annotated using macros from mfbt/ThreadSafety --
 *   MOZ_GUARDED_BY()/REQUIRES()/etc. MOZ_ANNOTATED is used in rare cases to
 *   indicate that is has been looked at, but it did not need any
 *   MOZ_GUARDED_BY()/REQUIRES()/etc (and thus static analysis knows it can
 * ignore this Mutex/Monitor/etc)

/**
 * Printf style formats.  MOZ_FORMAT_PRINTF and MOZ_FORMAT_WPRINTF can be used
 * to annotate a function or method that is "printf/wprintf-like"; this will let
 * (some) compilers check that the arguments match the template string.
 *
 * This macro takes two arguments.  The first argument is the argument
 * number of the template string.  The second argument is the argument
 * number of the '...' argument holding the arguments.
 *
 * Argument numbers start at 1.  Note that the implicit "this"
 * argument of a non-static member function counts as an argument.
 *
 * So, for a simple case like:
 *   void print_something (int whatever, const char *fmt, ...);
 * The corresponding annotation would be
 *   MOZ_FORMAT_PRINTF(2, 3)
 * However, if "print_something" were a non-static member function,
 * then the annotation would be:
 *   MOZ_FORMAT_PRINTF(3, 4)
 *
 * The second argument should be 0 for vprintf-like functions; that
 * is, those taking a va_list argument.
 *
 * Note that the checking is limited to standards-conforming
 * printf-likes, and in particular this should not be used for
 * PR_snprintf and friends, which are "printf-like" but which assign
 * different meanings to the various formats.
 *
 * MinGW requires special handling due to different format specifiers
 * on different platforms. The macro __MINGW_PRINTF_FORMAT maps to
 * either gnu_printf or ms_printf depending on where we are compiling
 * to avoid warnings on format specifiers that are legal.
 *
 * At time of writing MinGW has no wide equivalent to __MINGW_PRINTF_FORMAT;
 * therefore __MINGW_WPRINTF_FORMAT has been implemented following the same
 * pattern seen in MinGW's source.
