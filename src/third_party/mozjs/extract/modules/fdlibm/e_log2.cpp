	 * This is fairly efficient since f-hfsq only depends on f, so can
	 * be evaluated in parallel with R.  Not combining hfsq with R also
	 * keeps R small (though not as small as a true `lo' term would be),
	 * so that extra precision is not needed for terms involving R.
	 *
	 * Compiler bugs involving extra precision used to break Dekker's
	 * theorem for spitting f-hfsq as hi+lo, unless double_t was used
	 * or the multi-precision calculations were avoided when double_t
	 * has extra precision.  These problems are now automatically
	 * avoided as a side effect of the optimization of combining the
	 * Dekker splitting step with the clear-low-bits step.
	 *
	 * y must (for args near sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(2)) be added in extra
	 * precision to avoid a very large cancellation when x is very near
	 * these values.  Unlike the above cancellations, this problem is
	 * specific to base 2.  It is strange that adding +-1 is so much
	 * harder than adding +-ln2 or +-log10_2.
	 *
	 * This uses Dekker's theorem to normalize y+val_hi, so the
	 * compiler bugs are back in some configurations, sigh.  And I
	 * don't want to used double_t to avoid them, since that gives a
	 * pessimization and the support for avoiding the pessimization
	 * is not yet available.
	 *
	 * The multi-precision calculations for the multiplications are
	 * routine.
