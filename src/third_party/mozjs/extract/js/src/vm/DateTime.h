/**
 * Stores date/time information, particularly concerning the current local
 * time zone, and implements a small cache for daylight saving time offset
 * computation.
 *
 * The basic idea is premised upon this fact: the DST offset never changes more
 * than once in any thirty-day period.  If we know the offset at t_0 is o_0,
 * the offset at [t_1, t_2] is also o_0, where t_1 + 3_0 days == t_2,
 * t_1 <= t_0, and t0 <= t2.  (In other words, t_0 is always somewhere within a
 * thirty-day range where the DST offset is constant: DST changes never occur
 * more than once in any thirty-day period.)  Therefore, if we intelligently
 * retain knowledge of the offset for a range of dates (which may vary over
 * time), and if requests are usually for dates within that range, we can often
 * provide a response without repeated offset calculation.
 *
 * Our caching strategy is as follows: on the first request at date t_0 compute
 * the requested offset o_0.  Save { start: t_0, end: t_0, offset: o_0 } as the
 * cache's state.  Subsequent requests within that range are straightforwardly
 * handled.  If a request for t_i is far outside the range (more than thirty
 * days), compute o_i = dstOffset(t_i) and save { start: t_i, end: t_i,
 * offset: t_i }.  Otherwise attempt to *overextend* the range to either
 * [start - 30d, end] or [start, end + 30d] as appropriate to encompass
 * t_i.  If the offset o_i30 is the same as the cached offset, extend the
 * range.  Otherwise the over-guess crossed a DST change -- compute
 * o_i = dstOffset(t_i) and either extend the original range (if o_i == offset)
 * or start a new one beneath/above the current one with o_i30 as the offset.
 *
 * This cache strategy results in 0 to 2 DST offset computations.  The naive
 * always-compute strategy is 1 computation, and since cache maintenance is a
 * handful of integer arithmetic instructions the speed difference between
 * always-1 and 1-with-cache is negligible.  Caching loses if two computations
 * happen: when the date is within 30 days of the cached range and when that
 * 30-day range crosses a DST change.  This is relatively uncommon.  Further,
 * instances of such are often dominated by in-range hits, so caching is an
 * overall slight win.
 *
 * Why 30 days?  For correctness the duration must be smaller than any possible
 * duration between DST changes.  Past that, note that 1) a large duration
 * increases the likelihood of crossing a DST change while reducing the number
 * of cache misses, and 2) a small duration decreases the size of the cached
 * range while producing more misses.  Using a month as the interval change is
 * a balance between these two that tries to optimize for the calendar month at
 * a time that a site might display.  (One could imagine an adaptive duration
 * that accommodates near-DST-change dates better; we don't believe the
 * potential win from better caching offsets the loss from extra complexity.)

   * returns -3 hours as the local offset, but ICU flat out rejects the TZ value
   * and instead infers the default time zone via "/etc/localtime" (on Unix).
   * This offset can also differ from ICU when the operating system and ICU use

   * time zone have changed. Or, on Windows, when the Windows default time zone
