/*
 * [SMDOC] Bytecode Definitions
 *
 * SpiderMonkey bytecode instructions.
 *
 * To use this header, define a macro of the form:
 *
 *     #define MACRO(op, op_snake, token, length, nuses, ndefs, format) ...
 *
 * Then `FOR_EACH_OPCODE(MACRO)` invokes `MACRO` for every opcode.
 *
 * Field        Description
 * -----        -----------
 * op           UpperCamelCase form of opcode id
 * op_snake     snake_case form of opcode id
 * token        Pretty-printer string, or null if ugly
 * length       Number of bytes including any immediate operands
 * nuses        Number of stack slots consumed by bytecode, -1 if variadic
 * ndefs        Number of stack slots produced by bytecode
 * format       JOF_ flags describing instruction operand layout, etc.
 *
 * For more about `format`, see the comments on the `JOF_` constants defined in
 * BytecodeUtil.h.
 *
 *
 * [SMDOC] Bytecode Invariants
 *
 * Creating scripts that do not follow the rules can lead to undefined
 * behavior. Bytecode has many consumers, not just the interpreter: JITs,
 * analyses, the debugger. That's why the rules below apply even to code that
 * can't be reached in ordinary execution (such as code after an infinite loop
 * or inside an `if (false)` block).
 *
 * The `code()` of a script must be a packed (not aligned) sequence of valid
 * instructions from start to end. Each instruction has a single byte opcode
 * followed by a number of operand bytes based on the opcode.
 *
 * ## Jump instructions
 *
 * Operands named `offset`, `forwardOffset`, or `defaultOffset` are jump
 * offsets, the distance in bytes from the start of the current instruction to
 * the start of another instruction in the same script. Operands named
 * `forwardOffset` or `defaultOffset` must be positive.
 *
 * Forward jumps must jump to a `JSOp::JumpTarget` instruction.  Backward jumps,
 * indicated by negative offsets, must jump to a `JSOp::LoopHead` instruction.
 * Jump offsets can't be zero.
 *
 * Needless to say, scripts must not contain overlapping instruction sequences
 * (in the sense of <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_gene>).
 *
 * A script's `trynotes` and `scopeNotes` impose further constraints. Each try
 * note and each scope note marks a region of the bytecode where some invariant
 * holds, or some cleanup behavior is needed--that there's a for-in iterator in
 * a particular stack slot, for instance, which must be closed on error. All
 * paths into the span must establish that invariant. In practice, this means
 * other code never jumps into the span: the only way in is to execute the
 * bytecode instruction that sets up the invariant (in our example,
 * `JSOp::Iter`).
 *
 * If a script's `trynotes` (see "Try Notes" in JSScript.h) contain a
 * `JSTRY_CATCH` or `JSTRY_FINALLY` span, there must be a `JSOp::Try`
 * instruction immediately before the span and a `JSOp::JumpTarget immediately
 * after it. Instructions must not jump to this `JSOp::JumpTarget`. (The VM puts
 * us there on exception.) Furthermore, the instruction sequence immediately
 * following a `JSTRY_CATCH` span must read `JumpTarget; Exception` or, in
 * non-function scripts, `JumpTarget; Undefined; SetRval; Exception`. (These
 * instructions run with an exception pending; other instructions aren't
 * designed to handle that.)
 *
 * Unreachable instructions are allowed, but they have to follow all the rules.
 *
 * Control must not reach the end of a script. (Currently, the last instruction
 * is always JSOp::RetRval.)
 *
 * ## Other operands
 *
 * Operands named `nameIndex` or `atomIndex` (which appear on instructions that
 * have `JOF_ATOM` in the `format` field) must be valid indexes into
 * `script->atoms()`.
 *
 * Operands named `argc` (`JOF_ARGC`) are argument counts for call
 * instructions. `argc` must be small enough that the instruction's nuses is <=
 * the current stack depth (see "Stack depth" below).
 *
 * Operands named `argno` (`JOF_QARG`) refer to an argument of the current
 * function. `argno` must be in the range `0..script->function()->nargs()`.
 * Instructions with these operands must appear only in function scripts.
 *
 * Operands named `localno` (`JOF_LOCAL`) refer to a local variable stored in
 * the stack frame. `localno` must be in the range `0..script->nfixed()`.
 *
 * Operands named `resumeIndex` (`JOF_RESUMEINDEX`) refer to a resume point in
 * the current script. `resumeIndex` must be a valid index into
 * `script->resumeOffsets()`.
 *
 * Operands named `hops` and `slot` (`JOF_ENVCOORD`) refer a slot in an
 * `EnvironmentObject`. At run time, they must point to a fixed slot in an
 * object on the current environment chain. See `EnvironmentCoordinates`.
 *
 * Operands with the following names must be valid indexes into
 * `script->gcthings()`, and the pointer in the vector must point to the right
 * type of thing:
 *
 * -   `objectIndex` (`JOF_OBJECT`): `PlainObject*` or `ArrayObject*`
 * -   `baseobjIndex` (`JOF_OBJECT`): `PlainObject*`
 * -   `funcIndex` (`JOF_OBJECT`): `JSFunction*`
 * -   `regexpIndex` (`JOF_REGEXP`): `RegExpObject*`
 * -   `shapeIndex` (`JOF_SHAPE`): `Shape*`
 * -   `scopeIndex` (`JOF_SCOPE`): `Scope*`
 * -   `lexicalScopeIndex` (`JOF_SCOPE`): `LexicalScope*`
 * -   `classBodyScopeIndex` (`JOF_SCOPE`): `ClassBodyScope*`
 * -   `withScopeIndex` (`JOF_SCOPE`): `WithScope*`
 * -   `bigIntIndex` (`JOF_BIGINT`): `BigInt*`
 *
 * Operands named `icIndex` (`JOF_ICINDEX`) must be exactly the number of
 * preceding instructions in the script that have the JOF_IC flag.
 * (Rationale: Each JOF_IC instruction has a unique entry in
 * `script->jitScript()->icEntries()`.  At run time, in the bytecode
 * interpreter, we have to find that entry. We could store the IC index as an
 * operand to each JOF_IC instruction, but it's more memory-efficient to use a
 * counter and reset the counter to `icIndex` after each jump.)
 *
 * ## Stack depth
 *
 * Each instruction has a compile-time stack depth, the number of values on the
 * interpreter stack just before executing the instruction. It isn't explicitly
 * present in the bytecode itself, but (for reachable instructions, anyway)
 * it's a function of the bytecode.
 *
 * -   The first instruction has stack depth 0.
 *
 * -   Each successor of an instruction X has a stack depth equal to
 *
 *         X's stack depth - `js::StackUses(X)` + `js::StackDefs(X)`
 *
 *     except for `JSOp::Case` (below).
 *
 *     X's "successors" are: the next instruction in the script, if
 *     `js::FlowsIntoNext(op)` is true for X's opcode; one or more
 *     `JSOp::JumpTarget`s elsewhere, if X is a forward jump or
 *     `JSOp::TableSwitch`; and/or a `JSOp::LoopHead` if it's a backward jump.
 *
 * -   `JSOp::Case` is a special case because its stack behavior is eccentric.
 *     The formula above is correct for the next instruction. The jump target
 *     has a stack depth that is 1 less.
 *
 * -   The `JSOp::JumpTarget` instruction immediately following a `JSTRY_CATCH`
 *     or `JSTRY_FINALLY` span has the same stack depth as the `JSOp::Try`
 *     instruction that precedes the span.
 *
 *     Every instruction covered by the `JSTRY_CATCH` or `JSTRY_FINALLY` span
 *     must have a stack depth >= that value, so that error recovery is
 *     guaranteed to find enough values on the stack to resume there.
 *
 * -   `script->nslots() - script->nfixed()` must be >= the maximum stack
 *     depth of any instruction in `script`.  (The stack frame must be big
 *     enough to run the code.)
 *
 * `BytecodeParser::parse()` computes stack depths for every reachable
 * instruction in a script.
 *
 * ## Scopes and environments
 *
 * As with stack depth, each instruction has a static scope, which is a
 * compile-time characterization of the eventual run-time environment chain
 * when that instruction executes. Just as every instruction has a stack budget
 * (nuses/ndefs), every instruction either pushes a scope, pops a scope, or
 * neither. The same successor relation applies as above.
 *
 * Every scope used in a script is stored in the `JSScript::gcthings()` vector.
 * They can be accessed using `getScope(index)` if you know what `index` to
 * pass.
 *
 * The scope of every instruction (that's reachable via the successor relation)
 * is given in two independent ways: by the bytecode itself and by the scope
 * notes. The two sources must agree.
 *
 * ## Further rules
 *
 * All reachable instructions must be reachable without taking any backward
 * edges.
 *
 * Instructions with the `JOF_CHECKSLOPPY` flag must not be used in strict mode
 * code. `JOF_CHECKSTRICT` instructions must not be used in nonstrict code.
 *
 * Many instructions have their own additional rules. These are documented on
 * the various opcodes below (look for the word "must").

     *     from the stack, returning the result promise to the caller. (If this
     *     async call hasn't awaited before, the caller may be user code.
     *     Otherwise, the caller is self-hosted code using `resumeGenerator`.)
     *
     * 2.  In async generators:
     *
     *         ...                          # valueToAwait

     *     `AsyncAwait` is not used, so (1) the value returned to the caller by
