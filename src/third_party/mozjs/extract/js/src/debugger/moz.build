# We give js/src/debugger its own moz.build file, separate from
# js/src/moz.build, so that the object file names don't conflict with those from
# other directories. For example, js/src/debugger/Object.cpp and
# js/src/builtin/Object.cpp had better not smash each other's .o files when
# unified sources are disabled.
