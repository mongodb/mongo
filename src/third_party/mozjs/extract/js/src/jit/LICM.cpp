// reduction in memory traffic, compared to unconstrained LICMing.  Halving
// them to (50,12) gives a small overall increase in memory traffic,
// suggesting it excludes too many loops from LICM.  Doubling them to (200,50)
// gives a win that is even smaller than (100,25), hence (100,25) seems the
// best choice.

    // (b) If the loop contains a large number of blocks, we play safe and
    //     punt, in order to reduce the risk of creating excessive register
    //     pressure by hoisting lots of values out of the loop.  In a larger
    //     loop there's more likely to be duplication of invariant expressions
    //     within the loop body, and that duplication will be GVN'd but only
    //     within the scope of the loop body, so there's less loss from not
    //     lifting them out of the loop entirely.
    //
    // (c) If the loop contains a multiway switch with many successors, there
    //     could be paths with low probabilities, from which LICMing will be a
    //     net loss, especially if a large number of values are hoisted out.
    //     See bug 1708381 for a spectacular example and bug 1712078 for
    //     further discussion.
