// Implementation of the branch hinting proposal
// Some control instructions (if and br_if) can have a hint of the form
// Likely or unlikely. That means a specific branch will be likely/unlikely
// to be executed at runtime.

// In a first pass, we tag the basic blocks if we have a hint.
// In a Mir to Mir transformation, we read the hints and do something with it:
// - Unlikely blocks are pushed to the end of the function.
// Because of Ion's structure, we don't do that for blocks inside a loop.
// - TODO: do something for likely blocks.
// - TODO: register allocator can be tuned depending on the hints.
