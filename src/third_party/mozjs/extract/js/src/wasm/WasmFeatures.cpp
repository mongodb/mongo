/*
 * [SMDOC] Compiler and feature selection; compiler and feature availability.
 *
 * In order to make the computation of whether a wasm feature or wasm compiler
 * is available predictable, we have established some rules, and implemented
 * those rules.
 *
 * Code elsewhere should use the predicates below to test for features and
 * compilers, it should never try to compute feature and compiler availability
 * in other ways.
 *
 * At the outset, there is a set of selected compilers C containing at most one
 * baseline compiler [*] and at most one optimizing compiler [**], and a set of
 * selected features F.  These selections come from defaults and from overrides
 * by command line switches in the shell and javascript.option.wasm_X in the
 * browser.  Defaults for both features and compilers may be platform specific,
 * for example, some compilers may not be available on some platforms because
 * they do not support the architecture at all or they do not support features
 * that must be enabled by default on the platform.
 *
 * [*] Currently we have only one, "baseline" aka "Rabaldr", but other
 *     implementations have additional baseline translators, eg from wasm
 *     bytecode to an internal code processed by an interpreter.
 *
 * [**] Currently we have only one, "ion" aka "Baldr".
 *
 *
 * Compiler availability:
 *
 * The set of features F induces a set of available compilers A: these are the
 * compilers that all support all the features in F.  (Some of these compilers
 * may not be in the set C.)
 *
 * The sets C and A are intersected, yielding a set of enabled compilers E.
 * Notably, the set E may be empty, in which case wasm is effectively disabled
 * (though the WebAssembly object is still present in the global environment).
 *
 * An important consequence is that selecting a feature that is not supported by
 * a particular compiler disables that compiler completely -- there is no notion
 * of a compiler being available but suddenly failing when an unsupported
 * feature is used by a program.  If a compiler is available, it supports all
 * the features that have been selected.
 *
 * Equally important, a feature cannot be enabled by default on a platform if
 * the feature is not supported by all the compilers we wish to have enabled by
 * default on the platform.  We MUST by-default disable features on a platform
 * that are not supported by all the compilers on the platform.
 *
 * In a shell build, the testing functions wasmCompilersPresent,
 * wasmCompileMode, and wasmIonDisabledByFeatures can be used to probe compiler
 * availability and the reasons for a compiler being unavailable.
 *
 *
 * Feature availability:
 *
 * A feature is available if it is selected and there is at least one available
 * compiler that implements it.
 *
 * For example, --wasm-gc selects the GC feature, and if Baseline is available
 * then the feature is available.
 *
 * In a shell build, there are per-feature testing functions (of the form
 * wasmFeatureEnabled) to probe whether specific features are available.
