/*
 * [SMDOC] Linear memory addresses and bounds checking
 *
 * (Also see "WASM Linear Memory structure" in vm/ArrayBufferObject.cpp)
 *
 *
 * Memory addresses, bounds check avoidance, and the huge memory trick.
 *
 * A memory address in an access instruction has three components, the "memory
 * base", the "pointer", and the "offset".  The "memory base" - the HeapReg on
 * most platforms and a value loaded from the instance on x86 - is a native
 * pointer that points to the start of the linear memory array; we'll ignore the
 * memory base in the following.  The "pointer" is the i32 or i64 index supplied
 * by the program as a separate value argument to the access instruction; it is
 * usually variable but can be constant.  The "offset" is a constant encoded in
 * the access instruction.
 *
 * The "effective address" (EA) is the non-overflowed sum of the pointer and the
 * offset (if the sum overflows the program traps); the pointer, offset, and EA
 * all have the same type, i32 or i64.
 *
 * An access has an "access size", which is the number of bytes that are
 * accessed - currently up to 16 (for V128).  The highest-addressed byte to be
 * accessed by an access is thus the byte at (pointer+offset+access_size-1),
 * where offset+access_size-1 is compile-time evaluable.
 *
 * Bounds checking ensures that the entire access is in bounds, ie, that the
 * highest-addressed byte is at an offset in the linear memory below that of the
 * memory's current byteLength.
 *
 * To avoid performing an addition with overflow check and a compare-and-branch
 * bounds check for every memory access, we use some tricks:
 *
 * - An access-protected guard region of size R at the end of each memory is
 *   used to trap accesses to out-of-bounds offsets in the range
 *   0..R-access_size.  Thus the offset and the access size need not be added
 *   into the pointer before the bounds check, saving the add and overflow
 *   check.  The offset is added into the pointer without an overflow check
 *   either directly before the access or in the access instruction itself
 *   (depending on the ISA).  The pointer must still be explicitly
 *   bounds-checked.
 *
 * - On 64-bit systems where we determine there is plenty of virtual memory
 *   space (and ideally we determine that the VM system uses overcommit), a
 *   32-bit memory is implemented as a 4GB + R reservation, where the memory
 *   from the current heap length through the end of the reservation is
 *   access-protected.  The protected area R allows offsets up to R-access_size
 *   to be encoded in the access instruction.  The pointer need not be bounds
 *   checked explicitly, since it has only a 4GB range and thus points into the
 *   4GB part of the reservation.  The offset can be added into the pointer
 *   (using 64-bit arithmetic) either directly before the access or in the
 *   access instruction.
 *
 * The value of R differs in the two situations; in the first case it tends to
 * be small, currently 64KB; in the second case it is large, currently 2GB+64KB.
 * The difference is due to explicit bounds checking tending to be used on
 * 32-bit systems where memory and address space are scarce, while the implicit
 * bounds check is used only on 64-bit systems after ensuring that sufficient
 * address space is available in the process.  (2GB is really overkill, and
 * there's nothing magic about it; we could use something much smaller.)
 *
 * The implicit bounds checking strategy with the large reservation is known
 * below and elsewhere as the "huge memory trick" or just "huge memory".
 *
 * All memories in a process use the same strategy, selected at process startup.
 * The immediate reason for that is that the machine code embeds the strategy
 * it's been compiled with, and may later be exposed to memories originating
 * from different modules or directly from JS.  If the memories did not all use
 * the same strategy, and the same strategy as the code, linking would fail or
 * we would have to recompile the code.
 *
 *
 * The boundsCheckLimit.
 *
 * The bounds check limit that is stored in the instance is always valid and is
 * always a 64-bit datum, and it is always correct to load it and use it as a
 * 64-bit value.  However, in situations when the 32 upper bits are known to be
 * zero, it is also correct to load just the low 32 bits from the address of the
 * limit (which is always little-endian when a JIT is enabled), and use that
 * value as the limit.
 *
 * On x86 and arm32 (and on any other 32-bit platform, should there ever be
 * one), there is explicit bounds checking and the heap, whether memory32 or
 * memory64, is limited to 2GB; the bounds check limit can be treated as a
 * 32-bit quantity.
 *
 * On all 64-bit platforms, we may use explicit bounds checking or the huge
 * memory trick for memory32, but must always use explicit bounds checking for
 * memory64.  If the heap does not have a known maximum size or the known
 * maximum is greater than or equal to 4GB, then the bounds check limit must be
 * treated as a 64-bit quantity; otherwise it can be treated as a 32-bit
 * quantity.
 *
 * On x64 and arm64 with Baseline and Ion, we allow 32-bit memories up to 4GB,
 * and 64-bit memories can be larger.
 *
 * On mips64, memories are limited to 2GB, for now.
 *
 * Asm.js memories are limited to 2GB even on 64-bit platforms, and we can
 * always assume a 32-bit bounds check limit for asm.js.
 *
 *
 * Constant pointers.
 *
 * If the pointer is constant then the EA can be computed at compile time, and
 * if the EA is below the initial memory size then the bounds check can be
 * elided.
 *
 *
 * Alignment checks.
 *
 * On all platforms, some accesses (currently atomics) require an alignment
 * check: the EA must be naturally aligned for the datum being accessed.
 * However, we do not need to compute the EA properly, we care only about the
 * low bits - a cheap, overflowing add is fine, and if the offset is known
 * to be aligned, only the pointer need be checked.

// Bounds checks always compare the base of the memory access with the bounds
// check limit. If the memory access is unaligned, this means that, even if the
