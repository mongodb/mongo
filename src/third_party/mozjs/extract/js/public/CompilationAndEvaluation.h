 * NB: JS_ExecuteScript and the JS::Evaluate APIs come in two flavors: either
 * they use the global as the scope, or they take a HandleValueVector of
 * objects to use as the scope chain.  In the former case, the global is also
 * used as the "this" keyword value and the variables object (ECMA parlance for
 * where 'var' and 'function' bind names) of the execution context for script.
 * In the latter case, the first object in the provided list is used, unless the
 * list is empty, in which case the global is used.
 *
 * Why a runtime option?  The alternative is to add APIs duplicating those
 * for the other value of flags, and that doesn't seem worth the code bloat
 * cost.  Such new entry points would probably have less obvious names, too, so
 * would not tend to be used.  The ContextOptionsRef adjustment, OTOH, can be
 * more easily hacked into existing code that does not depend on the bug; such
 * code can continue to use the familiar JS::Evaluate, etc., entry points.
