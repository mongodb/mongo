/**
 * [SMDOC] Protecting the debuggee's job/microtask queue from debugger activity.
 *
 * When the JavaScript debugger interrupts the execution of some debuggee code
 * (for a breakpoint, for example), the debuggee's execution must be paused
 * while the developer takes time to look at it. During this interruption, other
 * tabs should remain active and usable. If the debuggee shares a main thread
 * with non-debuggee tabs, that means that the thread will have to process
 * non-debuggee HTML tasks and microtasks as usual, even as the debuggee's are
 * on hold until the debugger lets it continue execution. (Letting debuggee
 * microtasks run during the interruption would mean that, from the debuggee's
 * point of view, their side effects would take place wherever the breakpoint
 * was set - in general, not a place other code should ever run, and a violation
 * of the run-to-completion rule.)
 *
 * This means that, even though the timing and ordering of microtasks is
 * carefully specified by the standard - and important to preserve for
 * compatibility and predictability - debugger use may, correctly, have the
 * effect of reordering microtasks. During the interruption, microtasks enqueued
 * by non-debuggee tabs must run immediately alongside their HTML tasks as
 * usual, whereas any debuggee microtasks that were in the queue when the
 * interruption began must wait for the debuggee to be continued - and thus run
 * after microtasks enqueued after they were.
 *
 * Fortunately, this reordering is visible only at the global level: when
 * implemented correctly, it is not detectable by an individual debuggee. Note
 * that a debuggee should generally be a complete unit of similar-origin related
 * browsing contexts. Since non-debuggee activity falls outside that unit, it
 * should never be visible to the debuggee (except via mechanisms that are
 * already asynchronous, like events), so the debuggee should be unable to
 * detect non-debuggee microtasks running when they normally would not. As long
 * as behavior *visible to the debuggee* is unaffected by the interruption, we
 * have respected the spirit of the rule.
 *
 * Of course, even as we accept the general principle that interrupting the
 * debuggee should have as little detectable effect as possible, we still permit
 * the developer to do things like evaluate expressions at the console that have
 * arbitrary effects on the debuggee's stateâ€”effects that could never occur
 * naturally at that point in the program. But since these are explicitly
 * requested by the developer, who presumably knows what they're doing, we
 * support this as best we can. If the developer evaluates an expression in the
 * console that resolves a promise, it seems most natural for the promise's
 * reaction microtasks to run immediately, within the interruption. This is an
 * 'unnatural' time for the microtasks to run, but no more unnatural than the
 * evaluation that triggered them.
 *
 * So the overall behavior we need is as follows:
 *
 * - When the debugger interrupts a debuggee, the debuggee's microtask queue
 *   must be saved.
 *
 * - When debuggee execution resumes, the debuggee's microtask queue must be
 *   restored exactly as it was when the interruption occurred.
 *
 * - Non-debuggee task and microtask execution must take place normally during
 *   the interruption.
 *
 * Since each HTML task begins with an empty microtask queue, and it should not
 * be possible for a task to mix debuggee and non-debuggee code, interrupting a
 * debuggee should always find a microtask queue containing exclusively debuggee
 * microtasks, if any. So saving and restoring the microtask queue should affect
 * only the debuggee, not any non-debuggee content.
 *
 * AutoDebuggerJobQueueInterruption
 * --------------------------------
 *
 * AutoDebuggerJobQueueInterruption is an RAII class, meant for use by the
 * Debugger API implementation, that takes care of saving and restoring the
 * queue.
 *
 * Constructing and initializing an instance of AutoDebuggerJobQueueInterruption
 * sets aside the given JSContext's job queue, leaving the JSContext's queue
 * empty. When the AutoDebuggerJobQueueInterruption instance is destroyed, it
 * asserts that the JSContext's current job queue (holding jobs enqueued while
 * the AutoDebuggerJobQueueInterruption was alive) is empty, and restores the
 * saved queue to the JSContext.
 *
 * Since the Debugger API's behavior is up to us, we can specify that Debugger
 * hooks begin execution with an empty job queue, and that we drain the queue
 * after each hook function has run. This drain will be visible to debugger
 * hooks, and makes hook calls resemble HTML tasks, with their own automatic
 * microtask checkpoint. But, the drain will be invisible to the debuggee, as
 * its queue is preserved across the hook invocation.
 *
 * To protect the debuggee's job queue, Debugger takes care to invoke callback
 * functions only within the scope of an AutoDebuggerJobQueueInterruption
 * instance.
 *
 * Why not let the hook functions themselves take care of this?
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Certainly, we could leave responsibility for saving and restoring the job
 * queue to the Debugger hook functions themselves.
 *
 * In fact, early versions of this change tried making the devtools server save
 * and restore the queue explicitly, but because hooks are set and changed in
 * numerous places, it was hard to be confident that every case had been
 * covered, and it seemed that future changes could easily introduce new holes.
 *
 * Later versions of this change modified the accessor properties on the
 * Debugger objects' prototypes to automatically protect the job queue when
 * calling hooks, but the effect was essentially a monkeypatch applied to an API
 * we defined and control, which doesn't make sense.
 *
 * In the end, since promises have become such a pervasive part of JavaScript
 * programming, almost any imaginable use of Debugger would need to provide some
 * kind of protection for the debuggee's job queue, so it makes sense to simply
 * handle it once, carefully, in the implementation of Debugger itself.
