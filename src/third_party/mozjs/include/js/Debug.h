// [SMDOC] Debugger builder API
//
// Helping embedding code build objects for Debugger
// -------------------------------------------------
//
// Some Debugger API features lean on the embedding application to construct
// their result values. For example, Debugger.Frame.prototype.scriptEntryReason
// calls hooks provided by the embedding to construct values explaining why it
// invoked JavaScript; if F is a frame called from a mouse click event handler,
// F.scriptEntryReason would return an object of the form:
//
//   { eventType: "mousedown", event: <object> }
//
// where <object> is a Debugger.Object whose referent is the event being
// dispatched.
//
// However, Debugger implements a trust boundary. Debuggee code may be
// considered untrusted; debugger code needs to be protected from debuggee
// getters, setters, proxies, Object.watch watchpoints, and any other feature
// that might accidentally cause debugger code to set the debuggee running. The
// Debugger API tries to make it easy to write safe debugger code by only
// offering access to debuggee objects via Debugger.Object instances, which
// ensure that only those operations whose explicit purpose is to invoke
// debuggee code do so. But this protective membrane is only helpful if we
// interpose Debugger.Object instances in all the necessary spots.
//
// SpiderMonkey's compartment system also implements a trust boundary. The
// debuggee and debugger are always in different compartments. Inter-compartment
// work requires carefully tracking which compartment each JSObject or JS::Value
// belongs to, and ensuring that is is correctly wrapped for each operation.
//
// It seems precarious to expect the embedding's hooks to implement these trust
// boundaries. Instead, the JS::dbg::Builder API segregates the code which
// constructs trusted objects from that which deals with untrusted objects.
// Trusted objects have an entirely different C++ type, so code that improperly
// mixes trusted and untrusted objects is caught at compile time.
//
// In the structure shown above, there are two trusted objects, and one
// untrusted object:
//
// - The overall object, with the 'eventType' and 'event' properties, is a
//   trusted object. We're going to return it to D.F.p.scriptEntryReason's
//   caller, which will handle it directly.
//
// - The Debugger.Object instance appearing as the value of the 'event' property
//   is a trusted object. It belongs to the same Debugger instance as the
//   Debugger.Frame instance whose scriptEntryReason accessor was called, and
//   presents a safe reflection-oriented API for inspecting its referent, which
//   is:
//
// - The actual event object, an untrusted object, and the referent of the
//   Debugger.Object above. (Content can do things like replacing accessors on
//   Event.prototype.)
//
// Using JS::dbg::Builder, all objects and values the embedding deals with
// directly are considered untrusted, and are assumed to be debuggee values. The
// only way to construct trusted objects is to use Builder's own methods, which
// return a separate Object type. The only way to set a property on a trusted
// object is through that Object type. The actual trusted object is never
// exposed to the embedding.
//
// So, for example, the embedding might use code like the following to construct
// the object shown above, given a Builder passed to it by Debugger:
//
//    bool
//    MyScriptEntryReason::explain(JSContext* cx,
//                                 Builder& builder,
//                                 Builder::Object& result)
//    {
//        JSObject* eventObject = ... obtain debuggee event object somehow ...;
//        if (!eventObject) {
//            return false;
//        }
//        result = builder.newObject(cx);
//        return result &&
//               result.defineProperty(cx, "eventType",
//                                     SafelyFetchType(eventObject)) &&
//               result.defineProperty(cx, "event", eventObject);
//    }
//
//
// Object::defineProperty also accepts an Object as the value to store on the
// property. By its type, we know that the value is trusted, so we set it
// directly as the property's value, without interposing a Debugger.Object
// wrapper. This allows the embedding to builted nested structures of trusted
// objects.
//
// The Builder and Builder::Object methods take care of doing whatever
// compartment switching and wrapping are necessary to construct the trusted
// values in the Debugger's compartment.
//
// The Object type is self-rooting. Construction, assignment, and destruction
// all properly root the referent object.

// GC and notify Debuggers to call their onGarbageCollection hook.
