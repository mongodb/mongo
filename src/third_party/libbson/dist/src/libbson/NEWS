Libbson-1.7.0
=============

  * Changes to JSON encoding and decoding:
    * New functions bson_as_canonical_extended_json and
      bson_as_relaxed_extended_json convert BSON to canonical and relaxed
      extended JSON according to MongoDB Extended JSON Spec.
      Output for the existing bson_as_json function has not been changed.
    * When parsing JSON type wrappers like "$timestamp", any missing or extra
      keys are an error.
    * The JSON format for BSON regular expressions is now "$regularExpression":
      {"pattern": "...", "options": "..."}. The old format {"$regex": "...",
      "$options": "..."} is still parsed.
    * The JSON format for BSON binary elements is now "$binary": {"base64":
      "...", "subType": "..."}. The old format {"$binary": "...", "$type":
      "..."} is still parsed.
    * BSON dates can be parsed from "$date" as an ISO8601 date or "$numberLong"
      as milliseconds since the epoch: "t": {"$date": {"$numberLong": "1234"}}.
      Dates can no longer be formatted as raw integers. bson_as_json writes a
      BSON date after 1970 as "$date" with an ISO8601 string, and dates before
      1970 as negative milliseconds wrapped in "$numberLong".
      bson_as_canonical_extended_json always writes dates with "$numberLong".
      bson_as_relaxed_extended_json always writes dates with "$date".
    * The non-numbers NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity are now recognized (regardless
      of case) when parsing JSON.
  * CMake build now installs .pc files for programs that link to libbson using
    pkg-config. Both the CMake and Autotools build systems now install .cmake
    files for programs that link to libbson using CMake. Linking to libbson
    statically or dynamically is now much more convenient.
  * New CMake option, "ENABLE_STATIC", defaults to ON.
  * Minimum required CMake version has been increased to 3.1.
  * CMake remains experimental on non-Windows platforms and issues a warning now
  * New functions
    * bson_strcasecmp, a portable equivalent of strcasecmp.
    * bson_iter_as_double, cast the current value to double.
    * bson_iter_init_from_data, creates an iterator from BSON string.
    * bson_validate_with_error, checks a document like bson_validate does but
      also reports which key was invalid
  * New convenience macros
    * BSON_ITER_HOLDS_INT, checks if iterator holds int32 or int64
    * BSON_ITER_HOLDS_NUMBER, checks if iterator holds int32, int64 or double
  * Raised BSON recursion limit to 200


Libbson-1.6.0
=============

It is my pleasure to announce libbson-1.6.0.

New features and bug fixes:

  * Use jsonsl instead of libyajl as our JSON parsing library, parse JSON more
    strictly, fix minor parsing bugs.
  * Extended JSON documents like '{"$code": "...", "$scope": {}}' are now parsed
    into BSON "code" elements.
  * ISO8601 dates now allow years from 0000 to 9999 inclusive. Before, years
    before 1970 were prohibited.
  * BSON floats and ints are now distinguished in JSON output.
  * The library is now built and continuously tested with MinGW-W64 on Windows.
  * The documentation is ported from Mallard XML to ReStructured Text, the
    HTML documentation is restyled, and numerous man page syntax errors fixed.
  * All public functions now have the __cdecl calling convention on Windows.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the development of this release.

Libbson-1.5.0
=============

It is my pleasure to announce Libbson-1.5.0.

New features and bug fixes:

  * New BSON Type, Decimal128 (bson_decimal128_t) along with the following
    new functions and helpers:
    * bson_decimal128_to_string()
    * bson_decimal128_from_string()
    * bson_iter_decimal128()
    * bson_iter_overwrite_decimal128()
    * BSON_ITER_HOLDS_DECIMAL128()
    * bson_append_decimal128()
    * BSON_APPEND_DECIMAL128()
    * BCON_DECIMAL128()
    See the documentations for further details.
  * bson_validate and bson_iter_next now validate that BSON boolean values are
    0 or 1. Before, any non-zero value was considered true.
  * bson_append_code_with_scope now preserves the "code with scope" type
    if scope is an empty, non-NULL BSON document.
  * BSON "code" and "code with scope" types are properly translated to and from
    JSON of the form '{"$code": "...", "$scope": {...}}'.
  * bson_json_reader functions now always validate UTF-8.
  * JSON parsing now preserves integer width.
  * bson_strtoll now matches stroll: it detects range errors, and when
    parsing octal it stops at non-octal digits and returns what it parsed
    instead of setting errno.
  * New flag BSON_VALIDATE_EMPTY_KEYS causes bson_validate to fail if a document
    contains zero-length field names.
  * The configure option "--enable-hardening" had had no effect. It is removed
    in favor of system-wide compiler configuration.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the development of this release.

-- A. Jesse Jiryu Davis


Libbson-1.4.0
=============

It is my pleasure to announce Libbson-1.4.0.

New features and bug fixes:

  * bson_reader_reset seeks to the beginning of a BSON buffer.
  * bson_steal efficiently transfers contents from one bson_t to another.
  * Fix Windows compile error with BSON_EXTRA_ALIGN disabled.
  * Potential buffer overrun in bson_strndup.
  * bson_oid_to_string optimization for MS Visual Studio
  * bson_oid_is_valid accepts uppercase hex characters.
  * bson_json_reader_read aborted on some invalid Extended JSON documents.
  * All man page names now begin with "bson_" to avoid install conflicts.
  * Error messages sometimes truncated at 63 chars.

This release tentatively supports the new BSON decimal type when built with
"./configure --enable-experimental-features", or with
"cmake -DENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES=ON", but this feature may change
between now and libbson 1.5.

   compiled and exported if needed in i386 mode
 * Fix version check for GCC 5 and future versions of Clang
 * Fix warnings and errors building on various platforms

With this release, Libbson abandons the convention that odd-numbered patch
versions indicate unstable releases. We switch to simple semantic versioning:
1.1.5 is a stable release with bug fixes since 1.1.4. During subsequent
development the version will be "1.1.6-dev".

-- Jason Carey

Libbson 1.1.0
=============

It is my pleasure to announce to you the release of Libbson-1.1.0.

This release is a stable release with some ABI additions and bugfixes.

The below changes include the changes mentioned in the rc0.

ABI/API changes include:
 * RC0
   * Deprecation of bson_copy_to_excluding
   * Addition of bson_copy_to_excluding_noinit
 * Removal of MIN, MAX and ABS macros in favor of BSON_MIN, BSON_MAX and
   BSON_ABS.  Note this is a breaking source level change if you relied on
   these from bson.h.  Also note that this is not a breaking ABI change.
 * Addition of BSON_ERROR_BUFFER_SIZE macro

Other changes include:
 * RC0
   * Addition of a versioned ABI for the libbson shared library
   * fixed bson_get_monotonic_time fallback when a system monotonic clock can not
     be found.  Formerly failed to compile with an incorrect call to
     bson_gettimeofday
   * Allow the "dbref" convention in bson_validate when BSON_VALIDATE_DOLLAR_KEYS
     is present
   * Support for ISO-8601 or $numberLong dates in bson <-> json parsing
   * Quiet various compiler warnings

Libbson 0.98.0
==============

One more step closer to a 1.0!

This release has a few fixes as we near the finish line of a 1.0 release.
We have bumped the version to 0.98.0 to sync up with MongoDB C driver, which
is the primary consumer of this library.

This release includes a new memory callback vtable to help in embedding
situations that have their own custom allocator such as various language
runtimes.

A few compilation fixes for various C++ compilers have also been included.

A special thanks to:

 * Itay Neeman
 * Michael Whittaker

Happy Hacking!

-- Christian


Libbson 0.8.4
=============

Another incremental release with a couple of new functions and bugfixes.

In this release you will find the following changes:

 * Alignment fixes for Solaris Studio C compiler.
 * RPM and Debian packaging helpers.
 * bson_gettimeofday() has dropped the deprecated timezone field used
   when calling posix gettimeofday(). This eases portability concerns.
   It is technically an ABI break, but since the field was never set,
   in reality it shouldn't be an issue.
 * Multi-byte optimizations for bson_oid_to_string() have been disabled
   on non-x86 based platforms. This should aid in architecture portability.
 * The JSON parser can now support $numberLong.
 * bson_ascii_strtoll() has been added, which is a portable strtoll()
   implementation. This is primarily useful for Windows users and is
   used by the JSON parser.
 * A bug was fixed in bson_iter_find_descendent() where the wrong field
   could be matched if it's prefix matched the query.
 * bson_array_as_json() has been added to convert a bson_t as a top-level
   array.

Thanks to:
 * Kyle Suarez
 * Itay Neeman

Happy Hacking!


Libbson 0.8.2
=============

A bugfix release is here as a follow up to 0.8.0.

In this release you will find the following changes:

 * A fix for BCON when used from C++.
 * Change bson_next_power_of_two() to accept size_t. This should not be
   an ABI break since it is static inline.

Happy Hacking!


Libbson 0.8.0
=============

It's that time again, time for another Libbson release!

This cycle includes much, much more documentation for your perusing. There is
much more cross-referencing and structure for your navigation pleasure.

We've improved support for Libbson on a few more exotic platforms. SPARC
support is looking pretty good these days.

You'll also find some new examples in this release to help you get started a
bit faster. If there is something you'd like to see, just ask!

There are a few ABI breaks this cycle, as we are well on the road to a 1.0 and
would like things as clean as possible. I anticipate a few more during the next
couple of cycles, but we will try to keep them to a minimum.  With that said,
you *WILL* need to recompile your application against 0.8.0.

Happy Hacking!


Libbson 0.6.8
=============

Quickly following up on the 0.6.6 release is 0.6.8. This release contains
a couple of bugfixes and more support for older architectures.

On big-endian systems, bson_append_date_time() was not properly converting
to little-endian. This is now fixed.

We've added support for Sun Pro C Compiler on Solaris 10 and 11. This includes
support for SPARC systems as well as x86_64. In particular, intrinsics were
added for the Solaris/SPARC/SunProC combination. If you are running SunProC
on a non-Solaris platform, a fallback path will be used which is slower than
native support for atomics. Additionally, bson_gettimeofday() does not fully
support timezones under SunProC as struct timezone is not defined.

Libbson will now check for GLibc 2.19 to remove various warnings with both
_GNU_SOURCE and _BSD_SOURCE defined.

Happy Hacking!


Libbson 0.6.6
=============

Another release for your hacking pleasure!

First off, note that there are two ABI breaks as part of this release. We
felt they were important as they will help us stablize towards a 1.0 release.
It is recommended that you recompile against this version of libbson.

Lots of small fixes went into this release to help get things building better
on various platforms. Windows support should be improved and many warnings have
been cleaned up.

The signature of bson_realloc_func has changed to allow for context to be
provided. This should help in situations where a pointer to the memory pool is
required.

bson_destroy_with_steal() has been added so that you can steal a buffer instead
of freeing it when bson_destroy() is called.

bson_new_from_buffer() has been added so that you can provide your own realloc
function to manage the underlying buffer. This will be useful for bindings that
want to integrate their memory manager for bson documents.

bson_value_t is a new container type that can hold any bson type.

I'd like to thank everyone who contributed to this release.

Happy hacking!

Libbson 0.6.4
=============

This is just a followup release of libbson as we work towards stablizing for
the new mongo-c-driver release. In fact, it only includes build work and a
new macro, bson_clear().

Happy hacking!


Libbson 0.6.2
=============

A new Libbson release is already here as a follow up to the 0.6.0 release.

This release includes a few build and installation fixes. In particular,

 * Windows build fixes
 * CMake build fixes
 * C++ build fixes.

The monotonic clock is now more accurately calculated on Windows as well.
If you'd like to build on Windows, check out the section in README.md for
information on how to do so.

Happy hacking!


Libbson 0.6.0
=============

Many changes have gone into this release!

TL;DR

 * C99 types (from C89).
 * JSON parsing.
 * Lots of Operating System support, including Windows.
 * Parallel Test Suite.
 * Revamped build system.
 * A couple ABI breaks.

First off, 0.6.0 has gone through a significant amount of build system cleanup.
This should simplify using libbson as a submodule for those that wish to do so.
For example, the mongo-c-driver now does this using autotools.

Windows Vista and higher is now supported as a build target through the use of
cmake. See README.md for the instructions. Other platforms should continue to
use autotools.

The test suite has been improved and more tests added. We now generate random
seeds on every run to help catch more errors with additional fuzzing passes.
By default, the test suite will run all tests in parallel with subprocesses.
This should speed up execution of `make test' for contributors.

bson_string_t went through an ABI break to support power-of-two growth.

JSON parsing has been added through the bson_json_reader_t type. You can also
now use bson_init_from_json() for a simplified interface.

Types were revamped to appear to be using C99 types. If C99 types are
available, they will be used. If not, they will be emulated. This means you
can just go on using uint64_t and similar. We even use bool now.

Many functions have been made portable to deal with inconsistencies with Win32.

This release has been tested on the following operating systems:

 * RedHat Enterprise 5, 6, and 7 beta.
 * CentOS 6.5
 * Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 * Fedora 20
 * Windows 7
 * FreeBSD 10
 * DragonFly BSD
 * Solaris 11
 * SmartOS
 * mingw64

Thanks again and enjoy using libbson!

Libbson 0.4.0
=============

This release includes a few bug fixes and copious documentation. Additionally,
we improved our fuzz testing and found a couple issues in the process.  It is
suggested that everyone upgrade their installations to 0.4.0.

We have been busy adding a lot of documentation that we hope you will like.
Many `man' pages have been added for various API endpoints and structures.  If
you use vim, remember that you can jump to the documentation with <shift>k
while on a symbol.

Thanks and enjoy using libbson!

Libbson 0.2.4
=============

This release includes some more performance improvements and bug fixes.

It contains an important fix for dealing with invalid string lengths that could
cause an integer overflow when checking to see if the string length fits within
the end of the buffer.

There is preliminary support for Solaris on x86_64 and SPARC.

Generating OIDs is now simpler with the use of bson_context_get_default(). This
function will return a thread-safe generic bson_context_t implementation.
Alternatively, you may pass NULL to bson_oid_init() for the context and the
default context is automatically used.

The fuzz tests now use srand() with a 32-bit integer derived from /dev/urandom.

Endianess conversions are now performed by __builtin_bswap*() functions when
available with the GCC compiler.

Endianness conversions for the double type are now properly handled on
big-endian systems.

bson_reinit() has been added to cleanup code that needs to destroy and then
initialize a bson_t.

Validation of Code with Scope fields was absent from bson_validate(). This is
now supported.

Libbson 0.2.2
=============

This release includes a few performance improvements and bug fixes.

The bson_t structure is more efficient when growing allocated buffers.
The use of memalign() was unnecessary for allocated bson_t structures
and has therefore been removed. Performance sensitive allocations now
use bson_malloc() instead of calloc() and initialize fields directly.
Stack alignment of bson_t is now enforced through compiler intrinsics.

The unit tests can now support running inside of valgrind to check for
various memory leaks. Simply defing VALGRIND=valgrind when running
`make test`.

Enjoy libbson-0.2.2!


Libbson 0.2.0
=============

This is the initial release of Libbson. It has not yet reached API and ABI
maturity and is therefore subject to change without notice.  Developers are
encouraged to start using Libbson as we journey on the road to 1.0, where ABI
stability will be guaranteed.

Libbson is Apache 2.0 licensed so that it can be embedded in a multitude of
scenarios. This means that we try hard to not rely on external libraries.
Therefore, Libbson contains useful routines to help in portability as well
as BSON support.

Libbson is the basis of a new MongoDB C driver that will follow shortly.

Please see the doc/ directory for documentation on how to use Libbson. We
would love for you to contribute to Libbson, whether that is code,
documentation or packaging.
