    coverity scan CID  531843 is a false positive.
    There is no real problem though the scan says
    overflow is possible in the arithmetic.
    The analysis is wrong.

    Corrected wording clarifying that
    dwarf_language_version_data()
    and dwarfsrclanglname_version() returned
    string pointers must never be freed or
    dealloc'd by library callers.

    commit d60d790043895728716a06c0f79c85486fead270

    explaining the fix to meson.build.
            modified:   ChangeLog

2025-07-07:  MrSmÃ¶r
    commit 6a0ace2b192bd0e3b6c9bb465685280c5e85db8d

    Make meson generate a proper pkg-config file when absolute paths (#298)
    are specified for includedir and libdir etc.

    Showing just one example, the other two lines
    are equivalent
    Prefix and @0@ are in the output so if @0@ is full path
    it does not work, as it has mixed full paths onto prefix.

    -pkgconf.set('libdir', '${prefix}/@0@'.format(get_option('libdir')))

    A full path in @0@ means (via join_paths) that
    the prefix gets dropped (that is, path joining
    works sensibly).
    +pkgconf.set('libdir', join_paths('${prefix}','@0@'.format(get_option('libdir'))))

    Just for completeness, not because it's necessary
    (except for running full regression tests).

2025-05-30:  David Anderson
    commit ebb64d792278b8f2656e465b7676daa3b5ebd37c

    github Issue 293: cmake building dwarfgen and libdwarfp
    failed.
    The file failed to include three libdwarf files that
    needed to be compiled here to expose hidden libdwarf
    objects (to the libdwarfp context)
    +../libdwarf/dwarf_memcpy_swap.c
    +../libdwarf/dwarf_string.c
    +../libdwarf/dwarf_tsearchhash.c

    In addition added
    +if(MINGW OR MSYS OR WIN32)
    +    target_link_libraries(dwarfp PRIVATE dwarf)
    +endif()
    In 1ff164059b46b630d05c93a1a44ab8f955ee7b77 above
    simplified to just
    + target_link_libraries(dwarfp PRIVATE dwarf)

    Plus, revised the compiler flags settings to make this
    as much like the libdwarf CMakeLists.txt as possible:
     if (BUILD_SHARED)
    -    set(COMPILER_FLAGS -DLIBDWARF_BUILD -DPIC)
    +    if(NOT BUILD_DWARFGEN)
    +      set(CMAKE_C_VISIBILITY_PRESET hidden)
    +    endif()
    +    set(DEFS LIBDWARF_BUILD PIC)
     else()
    -    set(COMPILER_FLAGS -DLIBDWARF_STATIC)
    +    set(DEFS LIBDWARF_STATIC)
     endif()
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarfp/CMakeLists.txt

    Now we can build shared-library libdwarfp-2.dll on
    msys2.

    from two places (avoiding duplication)
    results in 20 lines less source code.

    commit 08ff7580f0afe0ea9b4ba61092cc545512e4360e

    On linux gdb and valgrind  and libc notice
    that printf of sequential byte pairs, where
    the byte-pairs accidentally overlap (!) due
    to a mistake in this source... is bogus.

    MacOS notices too, but it reports "Trace/BPT trap: 5"
    which is quite mysterious.
    This is a serious bug which has been in place
    since support for the DWARF5 .debug_names section
    was added.  It crashes the app reading the .debug_info
    section reliably.

    Of course simplereader is just an example, but
    still...needs to be correct

    It had been hidden from testing before due to an oversight in
    the  debugfissionb directory in regressiontests
    was coded. We now prevent corrupt
    DWARF with duplicated attributes in a PE file from
    showing an error and avoiding
    any meaingful test. Just for this case.
    So the tests are now fixed too.

    commit ad7d97b0434757cb3f43b77e0c322ae5005af9cf

    Added and documented
    dwarf_language_version_string()
    to the API so programs can interpret the
    version (as an integer) in detail should
    they wish to do so.

    The intent is the actual version is an integer
    and trivial to compare.  It's possible
    (though highly unlikely) that a real version
    might not be representable directly.
    DW_AT_language_version is a DWARF class CONSTANT,
    not a string.

    commit 2c78ec2d525b4e732060c897add64caa49d2ec3c

    Two places implicit conversion of attribute
    from Dwarf_Unsigned to Dwarf_Half gave warning.
    Now has two casts. By definition attribute
    numbers (names) fit in 16 bits.

    commit 43831b87e10e1e2503b625611ab66e00e256e4aa

    This completes the work for release 0.12.0
    (release date not yet scheduled) which enables
    use of mmap or malloc/read when libdwarf
    accesses object section data.

    A major compatibility break requiring
    code calling the library be recompiled with
    the new library.

    Systems without the functions/data to use mmap
    will compile normally, though the compatibility
    break is still applicable.

    Small changes may be required before release.

    Normal automatic update.

    and DW_AT_language_version from DWARF6

    to add either or both to DWARF5
    compiler output are officially allowed to use
    these now.
