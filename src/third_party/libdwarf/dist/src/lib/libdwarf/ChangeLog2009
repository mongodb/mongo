2009-12-30  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * configure: Regenerated with autoconf 2.64.
     * config.guess, config.sub: Delete these.
     * configure.in, README: The --enable-nonshared
       option was coded incorrectly. The configure
       options are --enable-shared and --disable-nonshared
       work correctly.  Options --disable-shared and --enable-nonshared work
       correctly as well (these are the default values).
2009-12-29  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * gennames.c: Add cast to int  in printf so that the printf with *
       as the field width sees an int, not size_t.
     * Makefile.in:  Add depenencies for libdwarf.so to match
       libdwarf.a
2009-12-26  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h, pro_section.c, pro_reloc_symbolic.c: Reformatted
       a few lines that were badly formatted.
       Initialized local variables where a few were not initialized
       (this did not affect correctness, just readability).
2009-11-27  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_form.c: Was an incorrect implemenation of
       the reading of DW_FORM_sec_offset.
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Improved the documentation on reading DW_FORM_sec_offset.
       See dwarf_global_formref() documentation.
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerate.
2009-11-27  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h, dwarf_form.c, dwarf_query.c: Adding
       new form-class for the old DW_AT_MIPS_fde
       SGI/IRIX extension (offset into .debug_frame).
2009-11-27  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h: Added dwarf_formexprloc() and a new
       error code for it.
     * dwarf_query.c: The new dwarf_get_form_class()
       function had a typo for the address class.
     * dwarf_form.c: dwarf_formexprloc() added so one can read
       DW_FORM_exprloc location expressions.
     * dwarf_error.c: New error added for dwarf_formexprloc().
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Document dwarf_formexprloc().
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerate.
2009-11-27  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h: Defines typedef Dwarf_Sig8 and
       the new function dwarf_formsig8().
     * dwarf_error.c: Now deals with the latest
       error codes, including a new one for dwarf_formsig8().
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Document dwarf_formsig8().
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerate.
2009-11-24  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h: Added enum dwarf_form_class_e and
       dwarf_get_form_class() so clients have a simple
       way to get the  form-class mentioned in the DWARF
       specification.
     * dwarf_query.c:  Implemented dwarf_get_form_class().
     * dwarf_die_deliv.c:  Added dwarf_next_cu_header_b()
       function as more useful than dwarf_next_cu_header().
     * dwarf_opaque.h:  Added commentary about CU record.
     * dwarf_elf_access.c:  Added commentary about the CU header
       data.
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Document dwarf_next_cu_header_b()
       and suggest users convert to it.
       Document dwarf_get_form_class().  Rev 1.84
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerate.
2009-11-23  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_line.c:  file_name_is_full_path() did not
       allow for lower case  in Windows root path
       detection (with --enable-windowspath at configure
       time).  Now it does.
2009-11-17  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * gennames.c: Check the return value from fgets().
     * dwarf_form.c, dwarf_util.c: Handle DW_FORM_sec_offset, new in DWARF4.
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Add comment to macro example to clarify its
       limitation (it cannot always work).
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerate.
2009-09-30  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h: Added  dwarf_insert_fde_inst_bytes()
       to simplify copying an fde.  Added dwarf_get_cie_index()
       to provide a direct specific way to get a cie index for an fde.
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Minor reformatting to make things easier to read.
       This is revision 1.82.  Documented the new function
       dwarf_get_cie_index().
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated.
     * dwarf.h: Corrected typo, DW_CFA_cfa_offset_extended_sf is
       really spelled DW_CFA_offset_extended_sf.
       Added final new attributes, tag, language.
     * pro_alloc.c: Reformatting a comment so the line is not so long.
     * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Clarified that some arguments in fde
       creation are MIPS/IRIX only (other targets should just pass 0).
       This is revision 1.27. Document the new function
       dwarf_insert_fde_inst_bytes().
     * libdwarf2p.1.pdf: Regenerated.
     * config.h.in: Added HAVE_WINDOWS_PATH.
     * configure.in: Added --enable-windowspath to set
       HAVE_WINDOWS_PATH.
     * configure: Regenerated.
     * pro_section.c: Now allows use of a block of fde instructions
       from dwarf_insert_fde_inst_bytes(). Some indentation fixed too.
     * dwarf_line.c: Added detection of Windows full path if
       HAVE_WINDOWS_PATH defined at library build time.
     * pro_frame.c: Now handles dwarf3 CFA operations (but not the
       expression operands yet).  Removed some duplicated code in
       a switch statement. Fixed commentary typos.
       Created new function dwarf_insert_fde_inst_bytes().
     * pro_frame.h: Added fields to support dwarf_insert_fde_inst_bytes().
     * dwarf_arange.c: dwarf_get_arange_cu_header_offset() was
       failing to load .debug_info, so a legitimate use of the function
       might crash a client.
     * dwarf_frame2.c: If there are CIE records but no FDEs this
       is not considered a 'NO ENTRY' case.  It is strange
       but not a formal error and we might want to access the orphan
       CIE records (to print them when debugging a compiler, for example).
     * README: Documented --enable-windowspath.
     * dwarf_frame.c: Adding dwarf_get_cie_index() convenience function.
2009-09-09  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Improved the discussion of
       dwarf_transform_to_disk_form.
     * libdwarf2p.1.pdf: Regenerated.
2009-08-12  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * pro_section.c: The Dwarf_Die argument to fde creation
       functions is really optional (NULL is ok) and only used
       for an IRIX/MIPS extension.  So the code now allows
       a NULL Dwarf_Die argument for these functions.
     * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Rev 1.24, 11 Aug 2009 now documents
       the argument as NULL for most users.
     * libdwarf2p.1.pdf: Regenerated Rev 1.24, 11 Aug 2009.
2009-08-07  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h: Added to Dwarf_Regtable_Entry_s
       and Dwarf_Regtable_Entry_s comments.
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Revised dwarf_set_frame_rule_table_size()
       description, making it a bit more complete.
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated, rev 1.81, 07 August 2009.
2009-08-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h: Interface to dwarf_expand_frame_instructions()
       changed, the original could not really work right.
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Documented revised dwarf_expand_frame_instructions().
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated, rev 1.80, 05 August 2009.
     * dwarf_frame.c: Fixed dwarf_expand_frame_instructions();
2009-08-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * gennames.c: Change include from getopt.h to unistd.h
       so the code is more universally compilable.
2009-07-24  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_frame.c: Change debug printf to use libdwarf.h DW_PR macros
       instead of %d.
2009-07-20  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h: Added DW_DLE_NO_ELF64_SUPPORT.
     * dwarf_elf_access.c: If one has no Elf64 libelf support at build time
       and runtime one finds an Elf64 object then we return
       an error (DW_DLE_NO_ELF64_SUPPORT).  Pretending we could handle
       the elf64 was a bug.
     * dwarf_error.c: Adding strings for new error codes.
     * dwarf_elf_access.c: Add error code argument.
     * dwarf_elf_access.h: Add error code argument.
     * dwarf_original_elf_init.c: Report the correct error code instead
       of a generic code.

2009-07-16  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h: Add an error message define relating to rela relocations.
     * dwarf_alloc.c: Add code to free malloc space (related
       to rela relocations).
     * config.h.in: Add ifdef for Sun host machines so rela processing
       does not segv.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Add a flag to the section data to note that we malloced
       space when rela relocations are involved.
     * dwarf_elf_access.c: Refine is_32bit_abs_reloc() and
       is_64bit_abs_reloc() for easier debugging.
       Add malloc call when doing rela processing
       as some host libelf libraries make some libelf data areas read-only
       (Solaris and Irix for example). The malloc space avoids getting
       a segv.
2009-07-13  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_elf_access.c: some cases had = where == was
       needed in the reloc switch code.
2009-07-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_opaque.h: New data for .rela and unify section data
       information.  The changes will require consumers supporting
       non-elf-objects to make small (hopefully simple) changes.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c: Note existence of .rela sections.
     * pro_forms.c: Explicitly allow DW_AT_const_value,
       DW_AT_entry_pc, DW_AT_call_file, DW_AT_call_line.
     * dwarf_ranges.c:  Use simplified _dwarf_load_section() interface.
       Change an accidental C++ style // comment to oldstyle C comment.
     * dwarf_print_lines.c, dwarf_form.c, dwarf_query.c,
       dwarf_vars.c, dwarf_pubtypes.c, dwarf_frame3.c, dwarf_funcs.c,
       dwarf_arange.c, dwarf_global.c, dwarf_init_finish.c,
       dwarf_line.c, dwarf_opaque.h, dwarf_string.c, dwarf_weaks.c
       dwarf_util.c, dwarf_loc.c, dwarf_frame.c, dwarf_macro.c,
       dwarf_types.c: Use simplified _dwarf_load_section() interface.

2009-07-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_init_finish.c: Unified some common code into
       a new local function , reducing file by 60 lines.
     * dwarf_init_finish.c: Has long checked the wrong field
       for duplicate debug_info and debug_abbrev. Fixed.
       Also noted SGI IRIX only sections by adding comments.
2009-07-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h: Adding new function dwarf_CU_dieoffset_given_die(),
        and comments on dwarf_get_cu_die_offset_given_cu_header_offset();
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: documenting dwarf_CU_dieoffset_given_die().
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: New structure Dwarf_Section_s consolidates
       section information into one struct per section with
       index and size so we remove many Dwarf_Debug_s fields.
     * dwarf_print_lines.c, dwarf_form.c, dwarf_query.c, dwarf_vars.c,
       dwarf_pubtypes.c, dwarf_frame3.c, dwarf_funcs.c,
       dwarf_alloc.c, dwarf_arange.c, dwarf_init_finish.c ,
       dwarf_ranges.c, dwarf_line.c, dwarf_abbrev.c, dwarf_string.c,
       dwarf_weaks.c, dwarf_frame2.c, dwarf_util.c, dwarf_loc.c,
       dwarf_die_deliv.c, dwarf_frame.c, dwarf_macro.c, dwarf_types.c,
       Reflect Dwarf_Section_s addition using its fields.
       Simplify years list of SGI copyright using y-y replacing comma list.
       Minor reformatting for consistency with 4-space indentation.
       Initialize uninitialized local variables at declaration.
     * dwarf_addr_finder.c, dwarf_print_lines.c: Initialize 'res'
       local variables at declaration to DW_DLV_ERROR.
     * dwarf_global.c: Add dwarf_CU_dieoffset_given_die().
       Reflect Dwarf_Section_s addition using its fields.
       Simplify years list of SGI copyright using y-y replacing comma list.
       Minor reformatting for consistency with 4-space indentation.
       Initialize uninitialized local variables at declaration.
2009-06-06  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * configure.in: The new option --enable_namestable
        switches build time to generate a runtime binary search
        in the dwarf_get_TAG_name() etc functions instead of the
        default switch statement (for the rare case one knows a
        compiler generates poor switch code).
      * configure: regenerated.
      * libdwarf.h: Correct format mistakes and omissions in
        the Dwarf_Regtable_Entry3_s comments.
        Add prototypes for dwarf_get_TAG_name() and the related
        new functions.
      * dwarf_frame.c: Add {} to clarify some 'if' ranges.
        Remove code updating the DW_FRAME_CFA_COL row when finishing
        up establishing the current frame table.  The code should never
        have been there. Fixed some indentation of function
        formal parameters.  Removed use of DW_FRAME_CFA_COL
        and use de_frame_cfa_col_number instead.
        In dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg (the older interface)
        correctly return the cfa table column in the 'old style'.
      * gennames.c: Copied from dwarfdump.c (with changes).
        This generates dwarf_names.c so that libdwarf has
        functions like dwarf_get_TAG_name() which returns
        functions like dwarf_get_TAG_name() which returns
        the tag as a string (through a pointer argument).
      * dwarf.h: The first word of a comment is now capitalized (1 place).
      * common.c: New, used by gennames.c.
      * common.h: New, used by gennames.c
      * Makefile.in: Now contains changes which build and run
        gennames and create dwarf_names.o (which is part
        of libdwarf).
      * libdwarf2.1.mm: Document the new libdwarf functions.
      * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated as rev 1.76, 6 June 2009.
2009-06-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf.h: added new DWARF4 attribute (etc) defines.
2009-05-10  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf_frame.c: Remove use of DW_FRAME_UNDEFINED_VAL in
        favor of the value in the dbg structure.
        Adding comments about the meaning of an error case.
2009-05-07  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * Makefile.in: Ensure temp files all get deleted.
2009-05-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Update _dwarf_get_size_of_val()
        call (with its new address_size argument).
      * dwarf_frame.c: Use the new ci_address_size instead
        of de_pointer_size.
      * dwarf_frame.h: Added  ci_address_size to cie
        in preparation for this value in DWARF4.
      * dwarf_util.h: Adding address_size functions
        and arguments declarations  so address_size can vary by CU.
      * dwarf_util.c: Adding address_size functions
        and arguments so address_size can vary by CU.
      * dwarf_loc.c: Adding function dwarf_loclist_from_expr_a()
        as a version with an address size argument.
      * dwarf_frame2.c: Now initializes new ci_address_size field.
      * dwarf_line.c: Now uses address size for CU instead of
        default de_pointer_size.
      * dwarf_ranges.c: File left out of svn before.
        Implements dwarf_get_ranges() and dwarf_get_ranges_a(),
        the latter is new with address size passed in via a DIE pointer.
      * dwarf_arange.c: Added commentary. Removed erroneous
        insistence that every aranges group have the same
        address_size as the main elf object.
      * dwarf_query.c: Adding address size to internal calls.
      * dwarf_print_lines.c: Added '(file number is %d)'
        to -l -v -v -v output as the
        file number and traditional C zero-origin index index of a
        line table header are not the same value
        (see DWARF3 documentation, the end of section 6.2.5.3).
      * libdwarf2.1.mm: Documented dwarf_loclist_from_expr_a()
         and  dwarf_get_ranges_a().
      * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated.
      * libdwarf.h: Add commentary.
        Add   dwarf_loclist_from_expr_a() and
        dwarf_get_ranges_a() interfaces so address_size passed in.
2009-04-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf.h, dwarf_frame.c: Added dwarf_set_frame_cfa_value().
        Added dwarf_set_frame_rule_initial_value() as proper
        spelling of dwarf_set_frame_rule_inital_value(), keeping
        the old spelling for compatibility.
      * libdwarf2.1.mm: Documented Added dwarf_set_frame_cfa_value(),
        corrected spelling to dwarf_set_frame_rule_initial_value().
      * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated.
      * dwarf_opaque.h: Added field de_frame_cfa_col_number so that
        we do not need to use magic macros at execution time.
      * dwarf_init_finish.c: Now sets de_frame_cfa_col_number,
        de_frame_same_value_number, and de_frame_undefined_value_number.
2009-02-02  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf.h: Added dwarf extensions reported by
        John Bishop.

      * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Expanded comments.
2009-03-16  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf.h: Fixed several instances of
        inconsistent indentation. Documented arguments
	to dwarf_uncompress_integer_block().
2009-02-17  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf_print_lines.c,dwarf_line.c,dwarf_frame.c: C99-isms
        of // comments and declarations-in-code do not belong in
	libdwarf.
2009-02-14  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf.h: Add support for compile-time definition
        of the format for Dwarf_Unsigned types.
        Using macros for DW_PR_DUx etc.
      * dwarf_print_lines.c: Use the DW_PR_DUx macros.
      * configure.in: Define --enable-nonstandardprintf
      * config.h.in: new #undef HAVE_NONSTANDARD_PRINTF_64_FORMAT
      * configure: Regenerated.
      * config.guess, config.sub: Latest version from GNU.

      * libdwarf.h: Added argument to dwarf_print_lines()
        for better error reporting.  Added dwarf_check_lineheader()
	which allows some error reporting when not calling dwarf_print_lines().
      * dwarf_print_lines.c: Implements dwarf_check_lineheader() now.
      * dwarf_sort_line.c: Match up with new arguments to
        dwarf_read_line_table_prefix().
      * dwarf_line.c: Implement new arguments to
        dwarf_read_line_table_prefix() for better error reporting.
	Allow erroneous ARM-compiler line table header to be used.
      * dwarf_line.h: Adding new argument to dwarf_read_line_table_prefix
        so we can report back on minor errors in the line table prefix.
2009-01-31  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf.h: Corrected  DW_DLE_LAST.
      * dwarf_frame.c: Remove accidental use of C99 mid-block
        variable definition.
