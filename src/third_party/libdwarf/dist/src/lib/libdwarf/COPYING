The libdwarf documentation:
	libdwarf.mm
	is based on material submitted to the UI PLSIG as proposed
	interfaces for dwarf, but completely rewritten.
        Copyright ownership is therefore SGI (but see the
        document for details)  and it seems clear that the
        intent was there was to be free
	copying with no fees.

    libdwarfp.mm
        is documentation of a set of interfaces
        (not part of the UI PLSIG proposals)
        and the document was written from scratch at SGI.
