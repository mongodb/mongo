2008-09-29  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>

      * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Make it clearer that dwarf_get_pubnames, dwarf_get_varnames,
        etc return a result across all compilation units (an entire section),
        not just for a single compilation unit. Document version 1.68.
      * libdwarf2p.1.pdf: Regenerated.
2008-08-08  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Removed some long time
        spelling mistakes: no technical change in content.
        Document version 1.67.
      * libdwarf2p.1.pdf: Regenerated.
2008-08-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf.h, dwarf_error.c:  DW_DLA_PUBTYPE_CONTEXT was a mistake,
        DW_DLE_PUBTYPE_CONTEXT was intended and is now the spelling (neither
        is used).
      * dwarf_pubtypes.c dwarf_vars.c dwarf_funcs.c dwarf_global.c dwarf_weaks.c:
        tabs removed and previous strange formatting generated by a tool
        removed (4 space indent per level now present).

2008-08-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf2.1.mm: There were numerous places the apostrophe
        was used incorrectly, thru is now spelled through,
        and a few other small typographical errors were corrected.
        The document revision id printed is now 1.67.
        There is no technical change in content.
      * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated.
2008-06-17  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>

      * dwarf_util.c: Altered abbreviations hash table for a small
        performance improvement and space saving.
      * dwarf_util.h: Changed declaration for space saving in dwarf
        abbreviations table.
2008-04-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf.h: A trivial change to make a declaration look better.
      * dwarf_abbrev.h: We record tags in more than 16 bits now just in case
        we encounter such a thing (increased ab_tag field size), though
        we should not find such.
      * dwarf_abbrev.c: Adding a comment about the dwarf TAG value.
      * dwarf_util.c: Initialize local variables at declaration for safety.
        Removed truncation of some values: internally record more bits.
        Rewrote handling of the abbrev table as the old one did not scale
        to large numbers of abbreviations (things got very slow).
      * dwarf_util.h: Now has a larger field size in the argument to
        _dwarf_get_abbrev_for_code (not quite necessary but not harmful).
      * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Initializing local variables at declaration and
        removing truncation of bits from some uleb values.
      * dwarf_die_deliv.h: Increased size of ab_code field.

        match new table size.
      * dwarf_alloc.c: Arrange handling of new DW_DLA_HASH_TABLE_ENTRY
        (most of the work done in dwarf_util.c).
2008-02-27  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf.h: Fixed minor typo in latest libdwarf.h that gcc did not
        complain about. Noted by Josh Fuhs.
2008-02-26  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf_alloc.h: Add comment giving placement of DWARF_SIMPLE_MALLOC.

        non-Elf object files.
      * dwarf_original_elf_init.c: dwarf_init(), dwarf_elf_init()
        moved here from dwarf_init_finish.c.
      * Makefile.in: Build new source files dwarf_original_elf_init.c
        and dwarf_elf_access.c.
      * dwarf_init_finish.c: All dependencies on libelf and elf
        have been removed.
      * dwarf_opaque.h: The elf related info is removed and Dwarf_Debug_s
        now contains a new structure (from libdwarf.h) to hide object
        information.
      * dwarf_elf_access.c: All the Elf-using code is now in this
        source file and elf details are kept in a struct defined and
        used here.   Non-libelf and non-elf object access code would
        write a new source file with their own details using this
        as an example.
      * dwarf_elf_access.h: Prototypes for calling between
        dwarf_original_elf_init.c and dwarf_elf_access.c.
2008-02-18  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf.h: Declare new object-access functions and structures.
      * dwarf_original_elf_init.c: Traditional dwarf_init() and dwarf_elf_init()
        are moved to this new source file.
      * Makefile.in: Add new source files.
      * dwarf_init_finish.c: Now uses the function pointers, not
        libelf specific fields or ifdefs.
      * pro_opaque.h:  Remove de_access field, it is unused.
      * dwarf_opaque.h: New fields for new object-access functions.
      * dwarf_elf_access.c: New implementation details for elf access functions
        moved here from dwarf_init_finish.c.
      * dwarf_elf_access.h: New function interface so  dwarf_elf_access.c
        and dwarf_original_elf_init.c can communicate.
2008-02-08  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_print_lines.c: Added commentary to clarify that
       dwarf_print_lines() and _dwarf_print_lines are intentionally
       identical.  Initialized local variables so they are alll
       visibly set to some sensible value.
2008-02-07  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_frame.c (_dwarf_fde_section_offset): A typo
       in the last release made this an infinite loop.
       A one character change fixed it. Thanks to Carlos Alberto
       Enciso for noticing the bug.
2008-02-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarf_incl.h, pro_incl.h: Moved #include of dwarf.h before libdwarf.h
     * pro_forms.c: Some newer attributes are now handled.
     * dwarf_print_lines.c: Removed unused #include.
     * dwarf_sort_line.c: Removed alloca use in favor of
       malloc and removed the alloca #include.
     * dwarf_line.c: Removed unused #include.
     * dwarf_line2.c: Removed unused #include.

2008-02-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h: Fix commentary mistakes.
2008-02-02  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf.h: Add DW_DLC_OFFSET_SIZE_64 for run-time
       selection of DWARF3 64bit extension producer offset generation.
     * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Document DW_DLC_OFFSET_SIZE_64.
     * pro_init.c (dwarf_producer_init): Now standard DWARF3 is the default.
     * configure.in: Add --enable-dwarf-format-sgi-irix for those
       wanting IRIX offset-style DWARF2. Add --enable-dwarf-format-strict-32bit
       for those wanting strictly 32bit offsets.
       Otherwise default to generating 64bit offsets from the producer code,
       but allow the DWARF3 extended 64bit offsets if the flag
        DW_DLC_OFFSET_SIZE_64 is turned on in the call to dwarf_producer_init().
     * config.h.in: Provide undefs for the offset macros.

2008-01-25  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * pro_die.c: Changed leading tabs to spaces.
2008-01-23  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * pro_die.c: Using di_last_child field dwarf_die_link
       goes from O(N) to O(1) in adding a child.
       Thanks to Daniel Gollub for the suggestion.
       An omission in linking left/right children is fixed.
       Changed some leading TABs to spaces.
     * pro_opaque.h: Add di_last_child field.
2008-01-14  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Added missing backslash to correct formatting
       error. Thanks to Daniel Golub for pointing out the ommission.
     * libdwarf2.p1.pdf: Regenerated.
