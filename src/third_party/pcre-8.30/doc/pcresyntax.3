.TH PCRESYNTAX 3
.SH NAME
PCRE - Perl-compatible regular expressions
.SH "PCRE REGULAR EXPRESSION SYNTAX SUMMARY"
.rs
.sp
The full syntax and semantics of the regular expressions that are supported by
PCRE are described in the
.\" HREF
\fBpcrepattern\fP
.\"
documentation. This document contains a quick-reference summary of the syntax.
.
.
.SH "QUOTING"
.rs
.sp
  \ex         where x is non-alphanumeric is a literal x
  \eQ...\eE    treat enclosed characters as literal
.
.
.SH "CHARACTERS"
.rs
.sp
  \ea         alarm, that is, the BEL character (hex 07)
  \ecx        "control-x", where x is any ASCII character
  \ee         escape (hex 1B)
  \ef         formfeed (hex 0C)
  \en         newline (hex 0A)
  \er         carriage return (hex 0D)
  \et         tab (hex 09)
  \eddd       character with octal code ddd, or backreference
  \exhh       character with hex code hh
  \ex{hhh..}  character with hex code hhh..
.
.
.SH "CHARACTER TYPES"
.rs
.sp
  .          any character except newline;
               in dotall mode, any character whatsoever
  \eC         one data unit, even in UTF mode (best avoided)
  \ed         a decimal digit
  \eD         a character that is not a decimal digit
  \eh         a horizontal whitespace character
  \eH         a character that is not a horizontal whitespace character
  \eN         a character that is not a newline
  \ep{\fIxx\fP}     a character with the \fIxx\fP property
  \eP{\fIxx\fP}     a character without the \fIxx\fP property
  \eR         a newline sequence
  \es         a whitespace character
  \eS         a character that is not a whitespace character
  \ev         a vertical whitespace character
  \eV         a character that is not a vertical whitespace character
  \ew         a "word" character
  \eW         a "non-word" character
  \eX         an extended Unicode sequence
.sp
In PCRE, by default, \ed, \eD, \es, \eS, \ew, and \eW recognize only ASCII
characters, even in a UTF mode. However, this can be changed by setting the
PCRE_UCP option.

  alnum       alphanumeric
  alpha       alphabetic
  ascii       0-127
  blank       space or tab

In PCRE, POSIX character set names recognize only ASCII characters by default,
but some of them use Unicode properties if PCRE_UCP is set. You can use
\eQ...\eE inside a character class.

.SH "BACKTRACKING CONTROL"
.rs
.sp
The following act immediately they are reached:
.sp
  (*ACCEPT)       force successful match
  (*FAIL)         force backtrack; synonym (*F)
  (*MARK:NAME)    set name to be passed back; synonym (*:NAME)
.sp
The following act only when a subsequent match failure causes a backtrack to
reach them. They all force a match failure, but they differ in what happens
afterwards. Those that advance the start-of-match point do so only if the
pattern is not anchored.
.sp
  (*COMMIT)       overall failure, no advance of starting point
  (*PRUNE)        advance to next starting character
  (*PRUNE:NAME)   equivalent to (*MARK:NAME)(*PRUNE)
  (*SKIP)         advance to current matching position
  (*SKIP:NAME)    advance to position corresponding to an earlier
                  (*MARK:NAME); if not found, the (*SKIP) is ignored
  (*THEN)         local failure, backtrack to next alternation
  (*THEN:NAME)    equivalent to (*MARK:NAME)(*THEN)
.
.
.SH "NEWLINE CONVENTIONS"
.rs
.sp
These are recognized only at the very start of the pattern or after a
(*BSR_...), (*UTF8), (*UTF16) or (*UCP) option.
.sp
  (*CR)           carriage return only
  (*LF)           linefeed only
  (*CRLF)         carriage return followed by linefeed

  (*ANY)          any Unicode newline sequence
.
.
.SH "WHAT \eR MATCHES"
.rs
.sp
These are recognized only at the very start of the pattern or after a
(*...) option that sets the newline convention or a UTF or UCP mode.
.sp
  (*BSR_ANYCRLF)  CR, LF, or CRLF
  (*BSR_UNICODE)  any Unicode newline sequence
.
