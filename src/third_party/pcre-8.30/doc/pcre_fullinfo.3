  \fIcode\fP                      Compiled regular expression
  \fIextra\fP                     Result of \fBpcre[16]_study()\fP or NULL
  \fIwhat\fP                      What information is required
  \fIwhere\fP                     Where to put the information
.sp
The following information is available:

  PCRE_INFO_SIZE            Size of compiled pattern
  PCRE_INFO_STUDYSIZE       Size of study data
.sp
The \fIwhere\fP argument must point to an integer variable, except for the
following \fIwhat\fP values:
.sp
  PCRE_INFO_DEFAULT_TABLES  const unsigned char *
  PCRE_INFO_FIRSTTABLE      const unsigned char *
  PCRE_INFO_NAMETABLE       PCRE_SPTR16           (16-bit library)
  PCRE_INFO_NAMETABLE       const unsigned char * (8-bit library)
  PCRE_INFO_OPTIONS         unsigned long int
  PCRE_INFO_SIZE            size_t
.sp
The yield of the function is zero on success or:
.sp
  PCRE_ERROR_NULL           the argument \fIcode\fP was NULL
                            the argument \fIwhere\fP was NULL
  PCRE_ERROR_BADMAGIC       the "magic number" was not found
  PCRE_ERROR_BADOPTION      the value of \fIwhat\fP was invalid
