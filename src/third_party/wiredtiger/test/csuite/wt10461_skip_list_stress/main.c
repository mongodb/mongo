/*
 * This test reproduces WT-10461 in which platforms with weak memory models such as ARM
 * can insert items into a skiplist using an incorrect next_stack. Upper levels of
 * the next_stack should always point to larger keys than lower levels of the stack
 * but we can violate this constraint if we have the following (simplified) scenario:
 *
 * 1. Four keys are added to the same insert list: A, B, C, and D. The keys are ordered
 *    such that A < B < C < D
 * 2. Keys A and D are already present in the insert list. Keys B and C are inserted
 *    at the same time with C inserted slightly earlier.
 * 3. As C is being inserted A's next_stack pointers - previously pointing at D - will
 *    be updated to point to C. These pointers are updated from the bottom of A's
 *    next_stack upwards.
 * 4. As B is preparing to be inserted it builds its own next_stack by choosing pointers
 *    from the top of A's next_stack and moving downwards.
 * 5. Provided that pointers in step 3 are written bottom up and pointers in step 4 are
 *    read top down the resulting pointers in B's next_stack will be consistent, but if
 *    pointers are read out of order in step 4 (due to weak memory models being more
 *    lenient about ordering of reads from memory) B can set an old pointer to key D
 *    in a lower level and then set a newer pointer to C in an upper level violating our
 *    constraint that upper levels in next_stacks must point to larger keys than lower
 *    levels.
 *
 * To reproduce the above we set up a scenario with a skip list containing keys "0" (A)
 * and "99999" (D). New keys are continually inserted in a decreasing order to represent
 * the insertion of C, while in a parallel thread we emulate the insertion of B by continually
 * calling __wt_search_insert for key "00". Note that we're not actually inserting B here,
 * just repeating the critical section of B's insertion where the out of order read can occur.
 * We run this __wt_search_insert in parallel across as many threads as possible to increase
 * the chance of the error firing.
