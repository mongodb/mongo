# the purpose of this test is to ensure we use monotonic clock instead of
# realtime clock in our code. we had the instances where WT is hanging when
# system clock shifts (for eg: due to NTP servers). this test calculates
# the execution time of a test(test_rwlock), shifts the clock -vely by that
# time period and reexecutes the test. if the difference in the two execution
# times is less than 20% test is considered passed. 20% is selected, based on
# assumption that other factors of the environment will influence the execution
# time by less than 20%.
