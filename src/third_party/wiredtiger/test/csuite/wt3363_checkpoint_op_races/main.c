 * Test case description: There are a number of operations that we run that we expect not to
 * conflict with or block against a running checkpoint. This test aims to run repeated checkpoints
 * in a thread, while running an assortment of operations that we expect to execute quickly on
 * further threads. To ensure that we catch any blockages we introduce a very large delay into the
 * checkpoint and measure that no operation takes 1/2 the length of this delay.
 *
 * Failure mode: We monitor the execution time of all operations and if we find any operation taking
 * longer than 1/2 the delay time, we abort dumping a core file which can be used to determine what
 * operation was blocked.
