The 'test/csuite' directory includes a collection of sanity tests written in C.
They are expected to be executed as part of 'make check' testing.

Each sub directory of 'test/csuite' include source code of one csuite test, and 
should have one corresponding task in the Evergreen (CI system) configuration file. 
See 'test/evergreen.yml' for details.

When a new csuite test is introduced, a corresponding new Evergreen task should be 
crafted and put into the Evergreen configuration file. We have a utility program 
'test/evergreen/evg_cfg.py' to help with identifying and auto-generating the
Evergreen configuration for new or missing csuite tests. The program checking
has been bound into developer workflow through 'dist/s_evergreen'. 

Some csuite tests that check WiredTiger's failure recovery have LazyFS variants,
which use LazyFS (a FUSE file system) to emulate losing the contents of the buffer
cache, such as to test the system behavior in face of sudden reboots or power
failures. To use these tests, you need to have FUSE 3 installed together with the
development libraries, have 'user_allow_other' enabled in /etc/fuse.conf, and you
need to also enable LazyFS in cmake via the '-DENABLE_LAZYFS=1' command-line
option. The tests are not currently available in Evergreen and must be run manually.
