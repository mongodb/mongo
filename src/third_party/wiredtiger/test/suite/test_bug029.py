# Test that WT correctly propogates the most recent checkpoint time
# across restarts. We validate this by reproducing the original bug
# from WT-9457: frequent checkpoints pushed the checkpoint clock time
# into the future such that immediately after a restart a backup could
# see its checkpoint deleted out from under it. The result was fatal
# read errors when restoring the backup.
