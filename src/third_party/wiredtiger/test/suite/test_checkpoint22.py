# test_checkpoint22.py
#
# Test that skipping trees in checkpoints doesn't cause us to use the wrong
# write generation.
#
# If an item contains txnids, they're hidden during unpack based on the write
# generation. The checkpoint cursor code contains logic to use the proper write
# generation for the checkpoint (which might not be the same as the current
# write generation) but there are opportunities for this to be wrong if the tree
# is not modified for a while and thus skipped during checkpointing.
#
# In this test we take an initial checkpoint while holding a read transaction
# open (to ensure txnids are written out), then without making more changes to
# the tree, shut down and restart and take another checkpoint. If we have messed
# up, reading the second checkpoint will use the write generation from before
# the restart and values we should see will disappear.
#
# To make this work we need to make sure the txnids after the restart are
# substantially smaller than the ones we need to see from before, so do 10000
# extra transactions up front before doing anything else.
#
# A more advanced variant of this test might try reading from _both_ checkpoints
# after restarting to make sure anything that should not be visible in the first
# checkpoint (because it wasn't done committing) is visible in the first
# checkpoint and not the second. However, to make that go we need to not just
# generate a torn transaction (which is enough of a nuisance already) but one
# where the entire transaction, or at least the entire transaction that applies
# to the tree we care about, gets written out in the checkpoint but that
# transaction's txnid is still not in the checkpoint's snapshot. Doing this
# reliably seems beyond the facilities we have available in Python -- writing a
# large amount of data to a second table and making the changes in the main table
# small might help but seems unlikely to be particularly reliable under load.
#
# If we gain a better way to generate torn transactions on purpose, it might be
# worth seeing if this more advanced variant can be set up. Note that for this
# case the first checkpoint must be named so it remains addressable.
#
# This test doesn't use timestamps; it is about transaction-level visibility.
# There doesn't seem any immediate reason to think timestamps would add anything.
