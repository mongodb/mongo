# hook_demo.py
#   Demonstration of hooks.  Run via:
#     python run.py --hook demo=N base01
#
#  These hooks are set up:
#  - alter wiredtiger_open arguments (in a benign way)
#  - report after wiredtiger_open is called.
#  - notify on session.open_cursor
#  - intercept the session.create call
#
#   With N == 0, the session.create call reports its arguments and calls original session.create.
#   with N == 1, it does an additional session.drop call (which should cause tests to fail);
#   with N == 2, it does an additional session.create after the drop call (which should work).
#
#   Note that notify hooks don't have to simply report, they can call other methods,
#   set attributes on objects, etc.  For example, one can save the open_cursor
#   config string as an attribute on the cursor object, and examine it in another
#   hooked method.
