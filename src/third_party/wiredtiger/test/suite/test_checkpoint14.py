        # in the second checkpoint. If test machine lag causes either transaction to commit

        # value_c in the second. But also, if we end up using the second checkpoint's snapshot
        # for the first checkpoint, we'll see value_b. So if this happens more than once in a
        # blue moon we should probably strengthen the test so we can more reliably distinguish
        # the cases, probably by doing a third transaction/checkpoint pair.
