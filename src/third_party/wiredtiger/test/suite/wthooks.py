# Hooks Overview
#
# Here are some useful terms to know, with some commentary for each.
#
#   API functions
#      potentially any WiredTiger API functions that a hook creator wishes to modify (like
#      Session.remove). In Python most everything is an object.  Of course an instance of
#      "Session" is an object, but also the "Session" class itself is an object. The Session.remove
#      function is also an object (of a certain form that can be called). Also in Python,
#      attributes on an object don't have to be "pre-declared", they can be created at any time.
#      So it's easy to imagine assigning Session._remove_orig to be (the original value of)
#      Session.remove, and then assigning Session.remove to be some other function object, that
#      knows how to do something and then perhaps calls Session._remove_orig .  This is the
#      essence of the hook concept.
#
#  Hook Creator:
#      A way to attach a set of "behavior modifications" to various API functions.  More precisely,
#      a hook creator derives from WiredTigerHookCreator and sets up a number of "hook functions",
#      that are actions that are done either just before, after, or instead of, an API function.
#      A XxxxHookCreator lives in a hook_xxxx.py file.  When a HookCreator is loaded, it may be
#      given an optional argument.  This argument comes from the original python command line.
#      For example, "python run.py --hook abc" loads hook_abc.py (where it expects to find a hook).
#      "python run.py --hook abc=123" loads hook_abc.py with an argument "123".
#
#  Hook Function:
#      One function that will be called before, after or instead of, an API function.  A hook
#      function will be bound to an API function.  It is the job of the HookCreator to set up that
#      binding.  It is possible to have multiple hook functions bound to the same API function.
#      A hook function that replaces an API function will have the same args as the function
#      it replaces (but there is a trick to give it additional context if needed -
#      see session_create_replace in hook_demo.py).
#
#  Hook Platform API:
#      A set of utility functions used by WiredTigerTestCase or other parts of the test framework
#      that may differ according to platform.  Rather than have hook specific implementations in the
#      test framework, the "platform API" is implemented by any hook that wants to override it.
#      Currently the hook specific implementation is all or nothing, in the future we may allow
#      subsets of the hook platform API to be implemented.


# For every API function altered, there is one of these objects
# stashed in the <class>._<api_name>_hooks attribute.

    # Before we call the function, we modify the args as indicated
    # by hooks.  Then we call the function, possibly with a replacement.
    # Finally, we'll call any notify hooks.

    # We only walk through the hook list once, and process the config
    # hooks while we're doing that, and copy any other hooks needed.

# WiredTigerHookManager -
# The hook manager class.  There is only one hook manager.  It is responsible for finding all the
# HookCreators at the beginning of the run, and calling setup_hooks() for each one, to have it bind
# hook functions to API functions.  The hook manager is initialized with a list of hook names. Each
# name is expanded, for example, "demo" causes the hook manager to load hook_demo.py, and to call
# the "initialize" global function in that file.  We expect "initialize" to return a list of objects
# (hooks) derived from WiredTigerHook (class defined below).  Generally, "initialize" returns a
# single object (setting up some number of "hook functions") but to allow flexibility for different
# sorts of packaging, we allow any number of hooks to be returned.
#
# A hook can set up any number of "hook functions".  See hook_demo.py for a sample hook class.
