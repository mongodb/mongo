#   Test the debug mode setting for cursor_copy.
# There's no great way to detect that cursor_copy is really working, as
# the extra malloc/free that WT does cannot easily be detected.  However,
# it's useful to run some tests with the mode enabled. We make a subclass
# of test_base03, so we'll inherit those tests to be run with the debug mode
# configuration enabled.
