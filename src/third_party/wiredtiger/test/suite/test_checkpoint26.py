# Test the timing stress setting for checkpoint_evict_page.
# The setting forces checkpoint to evict all pages that are reconciled. The debug mode is effective
# in testing scenarios where checkpoint itself starts to evict pages. Have a big enough cache and
# small data pages so that eviction activity is small, allowing checkpoint to reconcile and
# evict pages.
