# Make sure that when we open a cursor we secure the proper matching
# history store checkpoint, and don't bobble or lose it if the database
# moves on. Non-timestamp version.
#
# It doesn't make sense to run this test for named checkpoints, because
# regenerating a named checkpoint with the cursor open isn't allowed and
# generating two different checkpoints with different names doesn't make
# an interesting scenario. The concern is getting the matching version
# of WiredTigerCheckpoint and hanging onto it.
