# Test commit-level durability, logging and later checkpoints when a backup
# cursor is open. If a crash occurs on a source while a backup cursor is open
# WiredTiger restarts and recovers from the checkpoint prior to the backup
# cursor, therefore discarding the later checkpoint. The reason is that if a
# WiredTiger.backup file exists on restart, then it is used. Verify that commit
# level durability is applies after a crash.
