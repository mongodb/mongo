"""Python testtools extension for running unittest suites concurrently.

The `testtools` project provides a ConcurrentTestSuite class, but does
not provide a `make_tests` implementation needed to use it.

This allows you to parallelize a test run across a configurable number
of worker processes. While this can speed up CPU-bound test runs, it is
mainly useful for IO-bound tests that spend most of their time waiting for
data to arrive from someplace else and can benefit from cocncurrency.

Unix only.
