Subunit is licensed under two licenses, the Apache License, Version 2.0 or the
3-clause BSD License. You may use this project under either of these licenses
- choose the one that works best for you.

We require contributions to be licensed under both licenses. The primary
difference between them is that the Apache license takes care of potential
issues with Patents and other intellectual property concerns. This is
important to Subunit as Subunit wants to be license compatible in a very 
broad manner to allow reuse and incorporation into other projects.

Generally every source file in Subunit needs a license grant under both these
licenses.  As the code is shipped as a single unit, a brief form is used:
----
Copyright (c) [yyyy][,yyyy]* [name or 'Subunit Contributors']

Licensed under either the Apache License, Version 2.0 or the BSD 3-clause
license at the users choice. A copy of both licenses are available in the
project source as Apache-2.0 and BSD. You may not use this file except in
compliance with one of these two licences.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software
distributed under these licenses is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.  See the
license you chose for the specific language governing permissions and
limitations under that license.
----

Code that has been incorporated into Subunit from other projects will
naturally be under its own license, and will retain that license.

A known list of such code is maintained here:
* The runtests.py and python/subunit/tests/TestUtil.py module are GPL test
  support modules. They are not installed by Subunit - they are only ever
  used on the build machine.  Copyright 2004 Canonical Limited.
