testtools
=========

testtools is a set of extensions to the Python standard library's unit testing
framework.

These extensions have been derived from years of experience with unit testing
in Python and come from many different sources.


Documentation
-------------

If you would like to learn more about testtools, consult our documentation in
the 'doc/' directory.  You might like to start at 'doc/overview.rst' or
'doc/for-test-authors.rst'.

To build HTML versions of the documentation, make sure you have
sphinx installed and run ``make docs``.


Licensing
---------

This project is distributed under the MIT license and copyright is owned by
Jonathan M. Lange and the testtools authors. See LICENSE for details.

Some code in 'testtools/run.py' is taken from Python's unittest module, and is
copyright Steve Purcell and the Python Software Foundation, it is distributed
under the same license as Python, see LICENSE for details.


Supported platforms
-------------------

 * Python 3.7+ or PyPy3

If you would like to use testtools for earlier Pythons, consult the compatibility docs:

 * https://testtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#cross-python-compatibility

testtools probably works on all OSes that Python works on, but is most heavily
tested on Linux and macOS.


Optional Dependencies
---------------------

If you would like to use our Twisted support, then you will need the
``testtools[twisted]`` extra.

If you want to use ``fixtures`` then you can either install fixtures (e.g. from
https://launchpad.net/python-fixtures or https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fixtures)
or alternatively just make sure your fixture objects obey the same protocol.


Bug reports and patches
-----------------------

Please report bugs using Launchpad at <https://bugs.launchpad.net/testtools>.
Patches should be submitted as GitHub pull requests, or mailed to the authors.
See ``doc/hacking.rst`` for more details.

There's no mailing list for this project yet, however the testing-in-python
mailing list may be a useful resource:

History
-------

testtools used to be called 'pyunit3k'.  The name was changed to avoid
conflating the library with the Python 3.0 release (commonly referred to as
'py3k').
