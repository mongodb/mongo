testtools: tasteful testing for Python
======================================

testtools is a set of extensions to the Python standard library's unit testing
framework. These extensions have been derived from many years of experience
with unit testing in Python and come from many different sources. testtools
also ports recent unittest changes all the way back to Python 2.4.  The next
release of testtools will change that to support versions that are maintained
by the Python community instead, to allow the use of modern language features
within testtools.
