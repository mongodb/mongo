# Since Twisted is an optional dependency, it doesn't get installed by `python
# setup.py install`. However, if Twisted is not installed, then the
# documentation for our Twisted support code won't render on readthedocs.
#
# Thus, this requirements.txt is specifically devoted to readthedocs.org, so
# that it knows exactly what to install in order to render the full
# documentation.
