 * fuzzutil_sliced_input_init --
 *     Often, our fuzz target requires multiple inputs. For example, for configuration parsing we'd
 *     need a configuration string and a key to search for. We can do this by requiring the fuzzer
 *     to provide data with a number of arbitrary multi-byte separators. If you have a sentinel
 *     character, you can use that, otherwise patterns like 0xdeadbeef work fine too but make the
 *     corpus less readable. If the fuzzer doesn't supply data in that format, we can return out of
 *     the fuzz target. While our fuzz target will reject lots of input to begin with, the fuzzer
 *     will figure out that inputs with these separators yield better coverage and will craft more
 *     sensible inputs over time. This is what the sliced input component is designed for. It takes
 *     the data input, a separator and the number of slices that it should expect and populates a
 *     heap allocated array of data pointers to each separate input and their respective size.
