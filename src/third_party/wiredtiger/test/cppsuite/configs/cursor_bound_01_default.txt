# Configuration for cursor_bound_01 default test.
# During the test duration:
#   - M threads will keep inserting new random keys.
#   - N threads will execute search_near calls with random bounds set. Each search_near
# call with bounds set is verified against the default search_near.
#   - O threads will continuously remove random keys.
#   - P threads will continuously update random keys.
#   - Q threads will utilize the custom operation and will execute next() and prev() calls with
# random bounds.
