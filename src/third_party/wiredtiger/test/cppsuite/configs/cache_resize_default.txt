# Configuration for cache_resize:
# - Defines a thread that uses the custom operation to resize the cache during runtime.
# - Defines several insert threads used to perform transactions larger than 1MB.
# - Defines custom tracking
# - Defines a max waiting time before giving up the current operation when the cache is full. This
# is required as cache stuck issues are likely to happen given the nature of the test.
