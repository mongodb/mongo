# Configuration for search_near_03 default test.
# The population phase performs unique index insertions based on the number of collections and
# key count for each collection. 
# Threads:
#  - Each insert thread performs unique index insertions on existing prefixes.
#  - Each read thread counts the number of current records in each collection, and checks if the
# table has changed.
# For the stress test set a large key and value size, as we want the key and values to take enough
# space to split across pages.
