 * A WT_CURSOR handle is the interface to a cursor.

 *
 * In the common case, a cursor is used to access records in a table.  However,

 * projection of multiple columns), as an interface to statistics, configuration
 * data or application-specific data sources.  See WT_SESSION::open_cursor for

	 * representation.   The encoded representation has header information
	 * prepended and is written as a block to the underlying file object.
	 *
	 * On entry, \c page_max is the configured maximum size for objects of

	 *
	 * On entry, \c extra is a count of additional bytes that will be added
	 * to the encoded representation before it is written.  In other words,
	 * if the target write size is 8KB, the returned encoded representation
	 * should be less than or equal to (8KB - \c extra).  The method does
	 * not need to skip bytes in the destination buffer based on \c extra,
	 * the method should only use \c extra to decide how many bytes to store
	 * into the destination buffer for its ideal block size.
	 *
	 * On entry, \c src points to the source buffer; \c offsets is an array
	 * of \c slots 0-based offsets into \c src, where each offset is the
	 * start of a byte string, except for the last offset, which is the
	 * offset of the first byte past the end of the last byte string.  (In

	 * first byte of the first byte string in \c src, and
	 * <code>offsets[slots]</code> is the total length of all of the byte
	 * strings in the \c src buffer.)
	 *
	 * On entry, \c dst points to the destination buffer with a length
	 * of \c dst_len.  If the WT_COMPRESSOR::pre_size method is specified,

	 * strings passed by WiredTiger.  If the callback does not encode any
	 * of the byte strings and compression should not be retried, the
	 * callback should set \c result_slotsp to 0.
	 *
	 * If the callback does not encode any of the byte strings and
	 * compression should be retried with additional byte strings, the
	 * callback must return \c EAGAIN.  In that case, WiredTiger will
	 * accumulate more rows and repeat the call.
	 *
	 * If there are no more rows to accumulate or the callback indicates
	 * that it cannot be retried, WiredTiger writes the remaining rows
	 * using \c WT_COMPRESSOR::compress.
	 *
	 * On entry, \c final is zero if there are more rows to be written as
	 * part of this page (if there will be additional data provided to the
	 * callback), and non-zero if there are no more rows to be written as
	 * part of this page.  If \c final is set and the callback fails to

	 * calls to the callback.  If \c final is set and the callback encodes
	 * any number of rows, WiredTiger continues to call the callback until

	 * wanting to create disk blocks in specific sizes.
	 * WT_COMPRESSOR::compress_raw is not a replacement for

	 * (for example, if WT_COMPRESSOR::compress_raw callback chooses not to

	 * more rows to accumulate), will be passed to WT_COMPRESSOR::compress.
	 *
	 * The WT_COMPRESSOR::compress_raw callback is only called for objects
