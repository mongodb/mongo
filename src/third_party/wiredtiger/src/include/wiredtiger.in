	 * Additionally file handles returned by the file system behave as file handles to a

	 * local file, and does not imply any transferring of data to the shared object store.
	 *
	 * The directory argument to the WT_FILE_SYSTEM::fs_directory_list method is normally
	 * the empty string as the cloud equivalent (bucket) has already been given when
	 * customizing the file system.  If specified, the directory path is interpreted
	 * as another prefix, which is removed from the results.
	 *
	 * Names used by the file system methods are generally flat.  However, in some
	 * implementations of a file system returned by a storage source, "..", ".", "/"
	 * may have a particular meaning, as in a POSIX file system.  We suggest that
	 * these constructs be avoided when a caller chooses file names within the returned
	 * file system; they may be rejected by the implementation.  Within a bucket name,
	 * these characters may or may not be acceptable. That is implementation dependent.
	 * In the prefix, "/" is specifically allowed, as this may have performance or
	 * administrative benefits.  That said, within a prefix, certain combinations
	 * involving "/" may be rejected, for example "/../".
