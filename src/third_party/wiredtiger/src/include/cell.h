/*
 * WT_CELL --
 *	Variable-length cell type.
 *
 * Pages containing variable-length keys or values data (the WT_PAGE_ROW_INT,
 * WT_PAGE_ROW_LEAF, WT_PAGE_COL_INT and WT_PAGE_COL_VAR page types), have
 * cells after the page header.
 *
 * There are 4 basic cell types: keys and data (each of which has an overflow
 * form), deleted cells and off-page references.  The cell is usually followed
 * by additional data, varying by type: keys are followed by a chunk of data,
 * values are followed by an optional validity window and a chunk of data,
 * overflow and off-page cells are followed by an optional validity window and
 * an address cookie.
 *
 * Deleted cells are place-holders for column-store files, where entries cannot
 * be removed in order to preserve the record count.
 *
 * Note that deleted value cells (WT_CELL_DEL) are different from deleted-address
 * cells (WT_CELL_ADDR_DEL).
 *
 * Here's the cell use by page type:
 *
 * WT_PAGE_ROW_INT (row-store internal page):
 *	Keys and offpage-reference pairs (a WT_CELL_KEY or WT_CELL_KEY_OVFL
 * cell followed by a WT_CELL_ADDR_XXX cell).
 *
 * WT_PAGE_ROW_LEAF (row-store leaf page):
 *	Keys with optional data cells (a WT_CELL_KEY or WT_CELL_KEY_OVFL cell,
 *	normally followed by a WT_CELL_{VALUE,VALUE_COPY,VALUE_OVFL} cell).
 *
 *	WT_PAGE_ROW_LEAF pages optionally prefix-compress keys, using a single
 *	byte count immediately following the cell.
 *
 * WT_PAGE_COL_INT (Column-store internal page):
 *	Off-page references (a WT_CELL_ADDR_XXX cell).
 *
 * WT_PAGE_COL_VAR (Column-store leaf page storing variable-length cells):
 *	Data cells (a WT_CELL_{VALUE,VALUE_COPY,VALUE_OVFL} cell), or deleted
 * cells (a WT_CELL_DEL cell).
 *
 * WT_PAGE_COL_FIX (Column-store leaf page storing fixed-length data):
 *      Pairs of WT_CELL_KEY and WT_CELL_VALUE, where the key is always a recno,
 * and the value is empty but contains a non-empty time window.
 *
 * Each cell starts with a descriptor byte:
 *
 * Bits 1 and 2 are reserved for "short" key and value cells (that is, a cell
 * carrying data less than 64B, where we can store the data length in the cell
 * descriptor byte):
 *	0b00	Not a short key/data cell
 *	0b01	Short key cell
 *	0b10	Short key cell, with a following prefix-compression byte
 *	0b11	Short value cell
 * In the "short" variants, the other 6 bits of the descriptor byte are the
 * data length.
 *
 * Bit 3 marks an 8B packed, uint64_t value following the cell description byte.
 * (A run-length counter or a record number for variable-length column store.)
 *
 * Bit 4 marks a value with an additional descriptor byte. If this flag is set,
 * the next byte after the initial cell byte is an additional description byte.
 * The bottom bit in this additional byte indicates that the cell is part of a
 * prepared, and not yet committed transaction. The next 6 bits describe a validity
 * and durability window of timestamp/transaction IDs.  The top bit is currently unused.
 *
 * Bits 5-8 are cell "types".
