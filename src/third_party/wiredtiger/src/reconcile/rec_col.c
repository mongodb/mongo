     * entries to take from the page.
     *
     * In theory we shouldn't ever get pages with overlapping key ranges, even during salvage.
     * Because all the pages are the same size, they should always begin at the same recnos,
     * regardless of what might have happened at runtime.
     *
     * In practice this is not so clear; there are at least three ways that odd-sized pages can
     * appear (and it's possible that more might be added in the future) and once that happens, it
     * can happen differently on different runs and lead to overlapping key ranges detected during
     * salvage. (Because pages are never merged once written, in order to get overlapping ranges of
     * keys in VLCS one must also be seeing the results of different splits on different runs, so
     * such scenarios are within the scope of what salvage needs to handle.)
     *
     * First, odd-sized pages can be generated by in-memory (append) splits. These do not honor the
     * configured page size and are based on in-memory size estimates, which in FLCS are quite
     * different from on-disk sizes. The resulting sizes can be completely arbitrary. Note that even
     * if things are changed to keep this from happening in the future, it has been this way for a
     * long time so it's reasonable to assume that in general any deployed database with an FLCS
     * column can already have odd-sized pages in it.
     *
     * Second, it isn't clear that we prevent the user from changing the configured leaf_page_max
     * after there are already pages in the database, nor is it clear that we should; if this were
     * to happen we'll then have pages of multiple sizes. This is less likely to generate
     * overlapping ranges, but it isn't impossible, especially in conjunction with the next case.
     *
     * Third, because at salvage time we account for missing key ranges by writing larger pages and
     * splitting them again later, as described below, if there are odd-sized pages before salvage,
     * running salvage can shift around where the page boundaries are. Thus on a subsequent salvage
     * run, overlaps that wouldn't otherwise be possible can manifest.
     *
     * For these reasons, and because we don't want to have to refit the code later if more reasons
     * appear, and because it doesn't cost much, we do check for overlapping ranges during salvage
     * (this doesn't even require additional code because the column-store internal pages are the
     * same for VLCS and FLCS) and handle it here.

         * keys will appear in salvage->missing on the next keys. So salvage->missing may be not
         * only greater than the maximum page size but a multiple of it. Since we cannot split
         * during salvage, and unlike VLCS we have no compact representation for a large range of

         *
         * FUTURE: I've intentionally written the code here to allow the upstream code to
         * manufacture empty new pages and reconcile each of them with salvage->missing equal to the
         * intended items per page, instead of asking us to produce monster pages, since doing so

         *
         * FUTURE: Alternatively, when we get fast-delete support for column store it is reasonable
         * to teach the upstream code to produce fast-delete entries for whole missing pages rather
         * than have us materialize all the zeros.
         *
         * In principle if we have a small number of entries to take, we could generate a small page
         * rather than allocating the full size. At least for the moment this won't work because we

     * cheaper than writing out the waste space and then reading it back in. Note that in an ideal
     * world only the last page in the tree is short, so the waste is limited, but currently there
     * are also other ways for odd-sized pages to appear.)

     * (because there are no appends during salvage, and if we see appends to an oversize page at
     * some later point we aren't going to grow the page and they'll go on the next one) so we can
     * always put the auxiliary data in the right place up front.

     * However, this means that we should not assume the bitmap size is given by the btree maximum
     * leaf page size but get it from the reconciliation info.
     *
