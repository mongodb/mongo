/*! @page tune_cursor_persist Cursor persistence

Opening a new cursor is a relatively expensive operation in WiredTiger
(especially in table objects, where a logical cursor may require multiple,
underlying object cursors), and caching cursors can improve performance.
On the other hand, cursors hold positions in objects, and therefore
long-lived cursor positions can decrease performance by blocking page
eviction or looking like a long-lived transaction.

Best practices are to cache cursors, but use the WT_CURSOR::reset method
to discard the cursor's position in the object when the position is no
longer needed.  Additionally, use the WT_CURSOR::insert method instead
of the WT_CURSOR::update method when there's no need to hold a position
in the object, because the WT_CURSOR::insert method never holds a cursor
position and there's no need to call WT_CURSOR::reset.
