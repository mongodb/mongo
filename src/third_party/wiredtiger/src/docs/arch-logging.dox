/*! @arch_page arch-logging Logging

The WiredTiger logging subsystem implements a write-ahead log when configured.
It is a central resource recording changes made to different tables, by different
threads, into a file on disk. Its purpose is so that changes made since the most recent
checkpoint are not lost and can be recovered on restart after a crash (unclean shutdown).

@section log_files Log-related files in the database directory

There are three log-related file variants that users can see in the database directory:
\c WiredTigerLog.*, \c WiredTigerPreplog.* and \c WiredTigerTmplog.*.
The actual write-ahead log files are prepended with the string \c WiredTigerLog.
followed by ten digits of log file number. For example, \c WiredTigerLog.0000000001.
The other two log-related filenames are for log file pre-allocation. When pre-allocation
is configured (the default), new log files are created ahead of time containing the
log file header content and are ready in the directory for use. The header content is
written into a temporary file with the prefix \c WiredTigerTmplog. and again followed
by a number. Once the temporary file is completely filled with the required content,
synced to disk and closed, it is renamed to a prepared log file that other threads in
the system can rename to use as the next real log file. Prepared pre-allocated log files
that are ready to use have the prefix \c WiredTigerPreplog.

Only the numbering of the actual \c WiredTigerLog.* files is significant. There is
no relation between the numbers on those files and the number of the pre-allocated
files. For pre-allocation, unique names are needed to avoid any possibility of naming
collision and the numbering mechanism exists, so the code reuses it. But there is
no meaning to the numbers on the two pre-allocated file types.

There are a varying number of temporary and prepared log files in the directory. They
are removed immediately on startup. Old pre-allocated log files cannot be reused
on a restart because the log format and WiredTiger software could have changed in between runs.
See \ref log_threads for a discussion of pre-allocation.

@section log_configuration Configuration choices and their implications

Once the logging subsystem is enabled for the system, then other configuration settings
control the finer details of the logging subsystem. The \c remove=true setting turns on
automatic log file removal. That means that log files earlier than the most recently
completed checkpoint are removed.  There are times, even when configured on, that
automatic log removal is temporarily disabled inside the WiredTiger library.

Log removal is disabled when a backup cursor is open. WiredTiger must guarantee
that any log file name that may have been returned to a backup cursor remains in
existence for the lifetime of that cursor. Log removal is also disabled when
a log cursor is open. This cursor could be positioned anywhere in the log that
existed when the cursor was opened and walking the records, so all log files that
existed at open must continue to exist.

The (default) log file pre-allocation setting \c prealloc=true allows the system to
pre-allocate log files so that when application threads are writing their log
records, on the critical path, they do not incur the penalties of file creation
and having to sync the header or directory to the disk. Similar to automatic removal,
there are times when log file pre-allocation is disabled internally. Pre-allocation is
disabled when a backup cursor is open. The user may not walk the list of files returned in
the backup cursor, but can, instead, copy the directory contents itself. Therefore,
backup has a contract that all files that existed when the backup cursor was opened will
continue to exist for the lifetime of the backup cursor. Renaming pre-allocated log
files would violate that contract.

@section log_records Log operations and records

The unit written to the write-ahead log is a log record. Some log records are made up
of log operations. The most common log record containing operations is the transaction
commit log record. Log records are of type \c WT_LOG_RECORD. There is a 16-byte header
that contains information about this record such as its length on disk, its length
in memory, a record checksum and whether it is compressed or encrypted. Then the end of
the log record contains the data for the that record. All log records
are a multiple of 128 bytes. The reason for that was to avoid any false memory sharing
when writing records into a memory buffer.

Log operations describe the changes in a transaction. Modifications are collected in
a memory buffer in a transaction and then when the transaction commits, that set of
operations is given to the logging subsystem to write as a single commit log record.
Therefore, transactions consume memory with that buffer as long as the transaction
is active. The other implication of using this operations buffer is that it is
simply freed if the transaction is rolled back and there is nothing to record or
do for a rolled back transaction.

@section log_subsystem Logging subsystem data structures and algorithms

A log sequence number (LSN) identifies the location of a log record. In WiredTiger,
the LSN is a 64-bit number containing two values, a 32-bit file number and a 32-bit offset.
The file number portion of the LSN maps to the number in the \c WiredTigerLog. file name.
The offset portion of the LSN is the byte offset within that file where the log record starts.

There is a \c WT_LOG structure that contains the live information about the state of
the logging subsystem. This document does not itemize every field. It contains some
locks and condition variables for synchronization and a large set of LSNs for keeping
track of the state of the system. Some of the important LSNs maintained are:
- alloc_lsn: This is the LSN for the next log record allocation.
- ckpt_lsn: This is the LSN of the last checkpoint.
- sync_lsn: This is the LSN of the last record synced to disk.
- write_lsn: This is the LSN of the end of the last record written to the operating system.
- write_start_lsn: This is the LSN of the start of the last record written to the operating system.

As mentioned earlier, all log records are a multiple of 128 bytes, and that means
they also have a 128 byte minimum record size. If a buffer is not a multiple, the
logging subsystem allocates a 128-byte multiple rounded up buffer and copies the
record into that buffer and zero fills the tail.

Logging supports both compression and at-rest encryption. When compression is enabled,
WiredTiger only compresses if doing so may result in space savings. Therefore, small records
that already are below the 128 byte minimum size will not result in any space savings.
All user log records are encrypted when enabled, regardless of size. When both
compression and encryption are enabled, compression is performed first, then encryption.
That resulting log record is then rounded up to the 128-byte multiple.

WiredTiger uses a lock free mechanism to write records to the log
in the common path.  WiredTiger has a pool of log buffers called
slots and each thread entering the logging code reserves its memory
buffer via atomic operations and then fills in its part of the
memory. When all threads that are using the slot finish their copies
into the memory, then the slot can be released and written to the
file system. Slots remain open and the memory available for the
next thread to use until a flush is forced, the memory fills or a
timer expires.

This means that for the common case of a user committing a transaction with the
default synchronization setting of memory-only, the path of writing its record into
the write-ahead log becomes, essentially, two atomic operations and memory copies. The
common path does not require acquiring locks.

@section log_threads Internal Threads
There are several internal logging-related threads that perform
housekeeping on the logging subsystem. The main thread, called \c
log_server, is a general thread, meaning it performs several unrelated
tasks. It flushes out the current slot to the file system. It does
this flush every 50 milliseconds and this is done so that if a
system becomes idle, buffered log records in the memory of a slot
do not languish. The thread also performs log removal to discard
any log files that are no longer needed based on the checkpoint
LSN. Finally the main thread performs log file pre-allocation, if
configured. The pre-allocation algorithm is adaptable. If the thread
did not make sufficient numbers of pre-allocated log files the
system then makes more. If too few were used, then later pre-allocation
will create fewer of them.

There is another internal thread dedicated to managing operations on log files. This
is the \c log_file_server thread. I/O operations can be slow and costly so this
thread takes the burden of closing and syncing files to disk off of user application threads.
If a log file needs to be closed, then the application thread moves its file handle to the
\c log->log_close_fh field and signals this thread. This thread will fsync the file
handle, and then close it. Updating the \c log_close_lsn and the \c sync_lsn values when
those I/O operations are complete.

The third internal thread manages advancing the \c write_lsn. As the \c write_lsn must
be advanced in proper LSN order, it becomes a point of single threading
in the path of writing a log record. The goal is to avoid single threading application
threads. So after a log slot is written to the file system, the application thread
only needs to set the slot's state to a special state \c WT_LOG_SLOT_WRITTEN and
return. This internal thread then walks the array of log slots looking for written
slots and advances the \c write_lsn in the proper order. Along the way the thread
will coalesce adjacent LSNs of slots in order to advance the LSN in larger increments.
This thread will then clean up and mark the state of the processed slots
as \c WT_LOG_SLOT_FREE.

@section log_usage Using the log

In addition to storing a record of the operations performed to data in the write-ahead
log, users can write their own strings into the logs via the \c WT_SESSION::log_printf
method. That method takes a printf-style format string and arguments and will write
that string into the write-ahead log as a message record type.

Transactions are stored in the write-ahead log and their purpose is to allow recovery
in the case of crash or failure. When the system is restarted, WiredTiger will always
run recovery. If the system previously shutdown cleanly, then recovery determines that
the log does not need to be replayed. Otherwise, recovery replays all operations from
the LSN of the most recent checkpoint. When timestamps are in use, recovery also
performs a @ref arch-rts "rollback to stable" operation on tables that are not logged.

Users can access and view the records in the log using one of two methods. The most
common method is via the \c wt printlog command. The command utility will print the
entire log by default. The user can specify optional starting and ending LSNs on the
command line to limit the output. See @ref command_line for more information.

A log cursor can be opened up on a running system and that cursor
can walk forward through the log.  Log cursors are described in great detail on
the @ref cursor_log page.
