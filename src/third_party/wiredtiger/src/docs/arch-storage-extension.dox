@section extension_storage_source Cloud Storage Source Implementation

The WiredTiger extension API allows control over how files are stored via the storage source
abstraction layer. More information can be found about customizing storage sources in
@ref custom_storage_sources. There are three storage sources that extend WiredTiger's capability
to store data files into cloud storage through Azure, Google and AWS providers. The cloud storage
extensions provide a means to construct, configure and control a custom file system linked to a
cloud bucket. All three storage source implementations internally interact with the cloud storage
through their own C++ SDKs.

All storage sources implement the following key functionalities defined by the storage source
interface:
- Initialize the store, cloud provider's SDK, and create a logging module for the store.

- Provide an API to access and terminate the store. A reference count is incremented each time the
storage source reference is taken and decremented with its termination. When the reference count
drops to zero, the storage source is de-registered with WiredTiger and any allocated resources are
freed.

- The storage source also provides a function that can create an instance of a cloud file system
following the interface implementation of \c WT_FILE_SYSTEM. The file system has a one-to-one
connection to a bucket and requires an access token to perform operations on the bucket.

@section extension_connection Connection class

All extensions have a connection class which represents an active connection to a bucket. It
encapsulates and implements all the operations the filesystem requires. Instantiation of the
class object authenticates with the cloud provider and validates the existence of, and access to,
the configured bucket. The connection class exposes APIs to list the bucket contents filtered by a
directory and a prefix, check for an object's existence in the bucket, put an object in the cloud,
and get an object from the cloud. Though not required for the file system's implementation, the
class also provides the means to delete objects, to clean up artifacts from internal unit testing.

@section extension_cloud_file_system Cloud File System Interface

WiredTiger supports a database over a custom file system by exposing a \c WT_FILE_SYSTEM interface
for the end-user to implement. The store itself provides a means to configure as many file systems
as needed, each linked to a bucket. These file systems - \c GCP_FILE_SYSTEM, \c AZURE_FILE_SYSTEM
and \c S3_FILE_SYSTEM - are custom implementations provided by the storage source. These file
systems contain an instance of the connection class, hence providing an active connection to the
bucket embedded in the file system instance.

The cloud file system uses the functionality provided by the connection class to simulate a
write-once-read-many file system. The filesystem can list directory contents, check for a file's
presence, and access the file by creating a file handle.

The storage sources use the file system's put-object functionality to flush files into the cloud.
The Tier Manager inside WiredTiger directs this flush. Only S3 storage source files pushed to the
cloud are also copied to the local cache.

@section extension_cloud_file_handle Cloud File Handle Interface

Each storage source also implements the \c WT_FILE_HANDLE interface, to access the files
on the file system. Since the object store is read-only, all the write access methods are disabled.

@section extension_log_stat Messaging and Statistics
The cloud provider SDKs use the term logging differently to WiredTiger. The SDK's logging definition
refers to the error or informational messages that are generated when performing calls to the SDK.
The SDKs also provide their own log levels which are translated into WiredTiger messaging levels.

All of the cloud storage sources have their own messaging system and statistics to monitor the
state of the SDKs and the storage sources. The messaging system captures error and informational
messages from both the SDK and the custom storage source which are redirected into the WiredTiger
messaging system. The statistics are printed when the WiredTiger verbosity is set to \c WT_VERBOSE
or higher on the storage source.

@section s3_store S3 Storage source
The S3 store implements the following functionality defined by the storage source interface:

- The bucket is expected to be a string argument comprised of the bucket name and the
corresponding region separated by a ';', e.g. "bucket1;ap-southeast-2".

- The S3 store handles authentication with AWS, requiring the user to provide an access token. The
access token is comprised of an access key ID and a secret access key as a set. The S3 store
requires the token to be provided as a single string argument of the access key followed by the
secret key, separated by a ';'.

- The S3 store configures a directory on the local file system as a cache for object files. The
cache is used to keep a local copy of the file such that file operations doesn't need to go
over the network, thus mitigating network latency.

- When a S3 file handle is created, the local cache gets a copy of the S3 object if
it doesn't already have it. Since the local cache is a directory on the WiredTiger database's file
system, the file is accessed using a \c WT_FILE_HANDLE implementation native to WiredTiger.
Hence, a \c WT_FILE_HANDLE is kept encapsulated in the S3 file handle.

- The S3 store has created a logging class which extends the AWS SDK's logging system.

@section azure_gcp_store Azure and GCP Storage Source
The Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) stores implement the following functionality:

- The Azure and GCP stores follow different authentication methods to connect to their respective
SDKs. GCP requires setting a \c GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable with the
path to an authentication file and Azure requires the \c AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING environment
variable to be set.

- Another reference count is incremented each time the file handle reference is opened and
decremented with the close. When the reference count goes zero, the file system is de-registered
from the storage source and any allocated resources are freed.

- Whenever a GCP or Azure file handle is created, it does not require the file to be present in the
local file system. The file handle will directly interact with the connection class to handle all
file handle operations.

- The GCP store has created a logging class which extends the GCP SDK's logging backend and the
Azure store has created a logging class using the Azure SDK's callback function.
