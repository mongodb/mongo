/*! @page transactions Transactional applications

WiredTiger offers standard ACID-style transaction support where operations are
done at snapshot isolation and subsequently become durable. (Readers not
already familiar with these concepts may wish to see @ref explain_acid for a brief
discussion of ACID and @ref explain_isolation for a brief discussion of isolation
levels.)

There are three approaches to writing transactional programs in WiredTiger:
-# Applications supporting \b checkpoint-level durability, intended for
applications with simple transactions where updates become durable when
the last reference to the object is closed or at the next database checkpoint.

-# Applications supporting \b commit-level durability, which extends checkpoint-level
durability, adding logging to the database so updates are durable as
soon as their transaction successfully commits.

-# Applications using timestamps for fine-grained control of the database,
extending checkpoint-level durability. This allows applications to do things
like enforce a transactional commit order, read historical data and define
stability points for the entire database. Use of timestamps changes both the
consistency and durability models.

The first two approaches are relatively simple and have APIs which will be
familiar to database developers. The principal difference is that in the second
approach, applications may need to enclose operations in explicit transactional
API calls and must additionally configure and manage the log files required for
commit-level durability. The third approach is complex, has non-standard APIs,
and requires more database knowledge to successfully build applications. The
functionality and programmatic changes in each approach are additive. If this is
your first database application, building a complex application by starting at
the first approach and iterating to a complete application is recommended.

We will discuss these approaches in order, from the simplest to the most
complex.

If this is your first WiredTiger application, please read @ref explain_durability
for a discussion of WiredTiger durability models, so you can select the application
architecture that's appropriate for your needs.

\warning
Recovery is the process of restoring the database to a consistent state after
failure. Recovery is automatically performed by WiredTiger, as necessary, when a
database is opened. Recovery is required after the failure of any thread of
control in the application, where the failed thread might have been executing
inside of the WiredTiger library or open WiredTiger handles have been lost. If
any application thread of control exits unexpectedly while holding any database
resources of any kind, the application should close and re-open the database.
