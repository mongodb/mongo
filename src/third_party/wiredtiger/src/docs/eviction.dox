/*! @page eviction Eviction

All the operations performed in WiredTiger are on the data read into
pre-configured amount of memory. WiredTiger uses memory as a cache for
all the data on the disk and the data in memory forms the current
working set.

Since memory is limited and can't hold all the data stored on the disk,
WiredTiger has to continuously move data that is currently not being
accessed out of the memory to free up enough space to read data that
are requested by the user but currently reside on the disk back into
memory. This process is called eviction.

@section eviction_overview Eviction overview

The WiredTiger eviction runs in the background with one eviction server
thread and several eviction worker threads.

1) The eviction server thread walks the btrees and adds the least
recently used pages to the eviction queues until the queues are full.
2) The eviction workers continuously remove pages from the eviction
queue and try to evict them.

Eviction has to obtain exclusive access to the page as there may be
application threads still reading content on the page that is being
evicted.

There are three types of eviction in WiredTiger:

1) Clean eviction
2) History store eviction
3) Update restore eviction

@section clean_eviction Clean eviction

In the case of clean eviction, there is no dirty content on the page
and it is directly removed from the memory. After that, the page
remains solely on the disk unchanged.

@section hs_eviction History store eviction

For history store eviction, the page is modified but the changes are
all committed. Therefore, the page should be clean and can be removed
from memory after the dirty changes are written to the new disk image,
which is the data format WiredTiger stores on disk. The process that
builds the disk image is called reconciliation. In reconciliation,
WiredTiger writes the newest committed value of each key to the disk
image. All the older values of the key are moved to the history store
table. In the end, reconciliation flushes the new disk image to the
data file on the disk and later eviction removes the old page from
memory.

The history store table is the internal table for WiredTiger to store
historical values for all the user-created tables. Each entry in the
history store represents a historical value of a key in the
user-created tables. The pages in the history store table need to be
evicted and loaded back to memory as well. Different from the
user-created tables, all the content on the history store page is
committed as the historical values it stores must all be committed,
and each entry only has one value and a deletion marking the expiration
of the entry on its update chain. Therefore, history store pages should
always be clean after reconciliation and can be evicted from memory.
Besides, only having one committed value for each key in the history
store prevents eviction from moving content already in the history
store recursively to the history store when evicting a history store
page because we only move the values after the first committed value to
the history store.

@section update_restore_eviction Update restore eviction

Update restore eviction largely overlaps with history store eviction.
The difference is that there are uncommitted changes on the page and
WiredTiger cannot write them to the disk image. Instead, besides
writing the disk image to the disk, eviction also keeps the disk image
in memory and restores the uncommitted changes to the new disk image.

Since usually there is only a subset of keys that have uncommitted
changes, eviction only needs to restore those keys that are dirty
after reconciliation. Apart from that, eviction may split a page into
multiple pages and some of them may be clean after reconciliation
even though the old page before split has uncommitted changes.
Therefore, WiredTiger tracks whether it needs to do update restore
eviction at the key level and the page level.

At the key level, the key needs to be restored if it has uncommitted
updates. For each new page, restoration is required if any of the
keys on the new page needs to be restored. Once eviction decides to
restore a page, it will make a copy of the disk image in memory
during reconciliation.

For the restored keys, eviction also frees all the values that have
been written to the disk image or moved to the history store as there
is no need to duplicate them on the update chains. For the clean keys
that are not restored, their whole update chains are removed from
memory along with the old disk image.

@section exceptions Exceptions

Eviction works differently for in-memory databases. Since they don't
support the history store, eviction only discards the update chains
when all the values on the update chains are globally visible. For the
same reason, we cannot free the updates older than the update written
to the disk image. Because there is no disk storage for in-memory
database, eviction has to keep all the reconciled disk images in
memory.
