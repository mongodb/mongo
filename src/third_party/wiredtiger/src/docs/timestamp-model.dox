/*! @page timestamp_model Timestamp overview

Some applications have their own notion of time, for example, wanting to read
earlier data after a commit, or wanting to enforce an expected commit order for
transactions
different from the order otherwise assigned by WiredTiger. For such applications,
WiredTiger provides interfaces so applications can impose their time ordering on
the library. Additionally, timestamps allow applications to prepare
transactions, read the database as of a given timestamp, and choose a timestamp
for recovery after failure.

All transactions where timestamps are configured must run at snapshot isolation;
reduced isolation levels are not permitted.

@section timestamps_global Global timestamps

Applications using timestamps need to manage some global timestamp state. These
timestamps are queried using the WT_CONNECTION::query_timestamp method and set
using the WT_CONNECTION::set_timestamp method. See @ref timestamp_global_api
for a full explanation.

@section timestamp_transactions Timestamps and transactions

Individual transactions also have timestamp state. These timestamps are queried
using WT_SESSION::query_timestamp but are potentially set in a variety of
methods, to allow configuration at various stages of the transaction:
WT_SESSION::begin_transaction, WT_SESSION::commit_transaction,
WT_SESSION::prepare_transaction and WT_SESSION::timestamp_transaction.  See @ref
timestamp_txn_api for a full explanation.

@section timestamps_format Timestamp format

Timestamps are 64-bit unsigned integers naming a point in application time.
WiredTiger does not interpret timestamps other than expecting larger timestamps
to correspond to "later" times. Timestamp 0 is reserved, so timestamps must
start at 1 or greater. It is not necessary for timestamp values to be clock time
of any kind; an expected timestamp source is a global counter shared by
instances of an application distributed across a network, individually running
local WiredTiger databases.

Timestamps are read from and written to the WiredTiger API as hexadecimal
strings without any leading prefix like "0x".  Applications using timestamps
must format those time values as hexadecimal when querying or setting
timestamps in WiredTiger:

@snippet ex_all.c hexadecimal timestamp

@section timestamps_durability_commit Logged objects, commit-level durability and timestamps

\warning
For all objects for which logging is configured, that is, objects configured for
commit-level durability, timestamps are ignored and durability behaves as if
timestamps were not set. This means timestamps do not change run-time behavior
for logged objects. (For example, it is not possible to read historical data and
attempts to do so are ignored.) Commits are written into the log and
subsequently restored as part of database recovery, as they are without
timestamps.

In general, timestamp-based WiredTiger applications will mostly not
use commit-level durability. However, commit-level durability with
timestamps makes sense when there is an object in the database that acts as a
higher-level application write-ahead-log. In that case, the application's
high-level log is recovered to the most recent commit and then that log is used
to restore other objects in the system which used checkpoint-level durability.
The log itself cannot be timestamped, but can be used to store timestamps for
other data.

For that reason, it is not an error to modify both logged and non-logged objects
in transactions configured with timestamps, as the atomicity, consistency and
isolation features of ACID for all objects in the transaction are supported.
However, because the underlying objects will have different durability models,
applications must be prepared to handle the inconsistencies between logged and
non-logged objects that will be seen after recovery.

\warning Using both commit-level and checkpoint-level durability in the same
database requires caution. Configuring logging for the database will
automatically configure logging for each object in the database unless logging
is explicitly turned off when the object is created.

@section timestamps_durability_checkpoint Checkpoint durability and timestamps

Checkpoint durability is the expected choice for most objects when
timestamps are configured. The change from checkpoint durability without
timestamps is applications can set a maximum value for the timestamp of
each checkpoint (the "stable timestamp"), and during recovery objects
are returned to the stable timestamp
associated with the most recent checkpoint.  This gives the application
fine-grained control over the point to which recovery moves after failure.

\warning As in checkpoint durability without timestamps, transactions committed
after a checkpoint will be rolled back as part of recovery. However, with the
introduction of the stable timestamp as the checkpoint's timestamp, it becomes
possible for a transaction to be committed, followed by a checkpoint, and then
recovery would still roll back the transaction if the commit timestamp were
after the checkpoint's stable timestamp. Applications are therefore responsible
for ensuring such committed transactions are restored or abandoned as desired.
