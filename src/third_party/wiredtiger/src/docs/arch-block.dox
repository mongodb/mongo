/*! @arch_page arch-block Block Manager

The WiredTiger block manager subsystem manages the reading and writing of data
from the disk. It is designed to facilitate high performance, economic use of
disk space and customizability.

@section block What is a block?

A block is a chunk of data that is stored on the disk and operated on as a
single unit. Each WiredTiger data file (any file in the home directory with the
\c .wt suffix) is made up of these blocks. Each block consists of a page header,
a block header and contains a single page of the btree from which it was
generated. WiredTiger is a no-overwrite storage engine, and when blocks are
re-written, they are written to new locations in the file. The size of a block
is a multiple of the allocation size which is set during creation of the
associated WiredTiger data file see: WT_SESSION::create.

Once a block is written an address cookie is returned. This address cookie is
stored as the \c addr on the associated page ref. The \c WT_REF structure can
be found in \c btmem.h. The address cookie is opaque to other parts of the
system and cannot be interpreted meaningfully.

The address cookie is made up of 4 components:
 - offset: The offset in the file. In order to avoid storing large offsets this
   value is divided by the allocation size.
 - file_id: Optional and only relevant to the tiered storage type, the file_id
   is maintained in the address.
 - size: The size of the block, also divided by the allocation size.
 - checksum: The checksum of the block for validation purposes.

The block header contains the following fields:
 - size: The size of the block on disk, used when salvaging data from a corrupt
   file.
 - checksum: The checksum of the block, again used for salvaging.
 - flags: Flags set on the block itself.
 - padding

The page header is not described in this document but can be found in
\c btmem.h.

@section block_implementation Block manager implementation details

@subsection write_once Writing

The block manager decides where in the file a block will be written. It has two
forms of writing modes, "first fit" and "best fit". The default behavior is best
fit. While operating in best fit mode the block manager will search a skip list
of extents sorted by size, returning either an exact match or the next largest.
This is done to avoid fragmenting the file when possible. In first fit mode the
block manager will place the newly created block in the first available extent.
First fit mode is used for all root pages.

Additionally the block manager is a no-overwrite system. As such once a block is
written it cannot be modified. This is for crash recovery reasons, because if
the system were to crash during an overwrite the block state would be unknown.
This doesn't mean that the associated page cannot be modified, once the
associated page is modified a subsequent reconciliation will result in a new
block being created.

@subsection desc_block Descriptor blocks

A file is divided up into blocks. The first block in a file is special as it
contains metadata about the file and is referred to as the "descriptor block".
It contains the WiredTiger major and minor version, a checksum of the block
contents as well as a "magic" number to check against.

The descriptor block serves as a safety check to ensure that the file being
loaded into the block manager is actually a WiredTiger data file, that it
belongs to a compatible version of WiredTiger and that the entire file has not
been corrupted. WiredTiger also uses checksums to defend against file corruption
which is described in the @ref checksum section.

@subsection block_lists Extent lists

Internally, the block manager uses a data structure called an extent list or a
\c WT_EXTLIST to track file usage. An extent list consists of a series of
extents (or \c WT_EXT elements). Each extent uses a file offset and size to
track a portion of the file.

There are three extent lists that are maintained per checkpoint:

- \c alloc: The file ranges allocated for a given checkpoint.
- \c avail: The file ranges that are unused and available for allocation.
- \c discard: The file ranges freed in the current checkpoint.

The alloc and discard extent lists are maintained as a skiplist sorted by file
offset. The avail extent list also maintains an extra skiplist sorted by the
extent size to aid with allocating new blocks.

@section configuration Configuration options

There are a number of configuration options that affect the block manager's
behavior. This does not aim to be an exhaustive list, however, these are the
configuration options that are more commonly of interest to developers.

All of the configuration options below are passed into the \c WT_SESSION::create
API at the time of file creation.

@subsection alloc_size Allocation size

The allocation_size configuration controls the file unit allocation_size.
Any blocks allocated by the block manager must be a multiple of this value.

For example, if we specify an allocation_size of \c 4KB, blocks of size
\c 8KB and \c 12KB would be permitted but NOT \c 10KB. The allocation_size
is set to \c 4KB by default which is a good choice unless the OS or storage
device has special requirements.

@subsection checksum Checksum

The \c checksum "on" configuration can be provided during creation of the file.
This configuration instructs the block manager to checksum the full length of
the buffer provided to be written into the block. Be default it is enabled.
When disabled the block manager still does perform a checksum operation but only
the first 64 bytes of the buffer are included.

The checksum is used when reading blocks to validate their contents, it
is compared with the checksum extracted from the address cookie and it is
compared with a checksum generated from the buffer that was held in the block
being read. In both cases the checksum has to match.

There are other options that can be provided for this configuration option,
they are not discussed here.

@section block_usage How WiredTiger uses the block manager

@subsection creation File creation and the block manager

When a new file is created in WiredTiger via WT_SESSION::create, the file is
created on disk and the associated \c allocation_size is written out to the
metadata file. However the block manager itself only exists on the btree
structure and is allocated when opening a closed btree.

@subsection read Reading files and pages

When an existing btree is opened for the first time, the location of the root
block is contained in the metadata file \c WiredTiger.wt. The block manager will
read the block at the location specified and return the page image as a buffer
to the layer above. This will then be instantiated as a page in memory.

From there subsequent page addresses can be read from the root page and the
process repeated as required. If a cursor traverses to a page which hasn't been
read into memory the same process will take place.

@subsection Writing

Two cases exist for writing out data using the block manager: checkpoint and
eviction. When a page image is written out the block manager the \c bm->write
API is called. See \c bt_io.c for more detail.

@subsubsection Checkpoint

For details on checkpoint at the WiredTiger level see: @ref arch-checkpoint "Checkpoint".

At the block manager level, a checkpoint corresponds with a set of blocks that
are stored in the file associated with the given URI. Typically each file will
contain a minimum of two checkpoints. Upon opening an existing file the most
recent checkpoint is read.

During a checkpoint new blocks are only written out for dirty pages. A block can
be included in multiple checkpoints. Assuming a page \c X is dirty and gets
checkpointed in checkpoint \c A, it will be created as a new block on disk. Now
the same page \c X isn't modified and another checkpoint is taken. The page is
clean and as such will not require a new block to be written for it. The address
of the original block is still valid.

Checkpoints are created in depth first order, leaf blocks are created, then
the parent blocks. This is a requirement as the parent blocks contain the
addresses of the leaf blocks.

The block manager doesn't guarantee that calling \c bm->write will result in
the data being flushed to disk. In the checkpoint scenario WiredTiger will also
call \c bm->sync once all blocks have been written which will call the file
system dependent flush function.

* Checkpoint deletion and merging *

As a checkpoint progresses it takes a snapshot of the three extent lists kept
by the block manager, these extent lists are written out to disk as part of
the checkpoint in blocks. Between checkpoints these extent lists are being
updated via normal operation of WiredTiger.

Suppose we have a checkpoint \c A, which has an alloc list which contains 3
blocks \c I, \c J, \c K as such its extent lists are as follows:

Alloc: \c I, \c J, \c K
Avail: \c L, \c M
Discard: Empty

A second checkpoint \c B completes and has removed a page which corresponds with
block \c J, it also has allocated an additional block \c L.

Checkpoint \c B's extent lists are as follows:
Alloc: \c L
Avail: \c M
Discard: \c J

Finally we complete a 3rd checkpoint \c C which allocates an additional block
\c M. Upon completion of this checkpoint we are able to remove checkpoint \c A,
to do that, the block manager will merge checkpoint \c A's extent lists into
checkpoint \c B's.

What's important here is that if a block appears in both the alloc list and
the discard list it can be freed which means it goes on the avail list.

Which gives us the following lists for checkpoint \c C:
Alloc: \c M
Avail: Empty
Discard: Empty

And the following lists for checkpoint \c B:
Alloc: \c I, \c K, \c L
Avail: \c J
Discard: Empty

These extent lists are written out with the checkpoint \c C. Anything on the
avail list is considered free space and can be reused as of the completion
of checkpoint \c C.

We don't want to list each block individually in the extent lists, so instead of
listing each block separately in the list, we use extents, which can describe a
range in the file, that is, any number of contiguous blocks.

@subsubsection Eviction

For more detail on how WiredTiger eviction works see: @ref arch-eviction "Eviction".

Eviction also utilizes the block manager. When a page is evicted and contains
data that needs to be maintained, logically a block needs to be written.
Eviction calls \c bm->write however it does not instruct the block manager to
sync the data.

@subsection Compaction

As new blocks are written, the block manager will place them where they fit best.
Because of this it's common that removal of data will not result in the file
shrinking. The file can only be shrunk when there are available blocks at the
end of the file.

To manage this, WiredTiger provides a compaction API call WT_SESSION::compact.
The block manager operates in first fit mode during compaction to maximize block
movement towards the beginning of the file. WiredTiger walks the btree and asks
the block manager if relocating that page will reduce the file size. If so, the
page is marked dirty, forcing the block to be rewritten. WiredTiger then
performs two checkpoints, as at least two checkpoints are required to delete the
checkpoint originally containing the block.

For more details about the compaction process, please refer to @ref arch-compact "Compaction".
