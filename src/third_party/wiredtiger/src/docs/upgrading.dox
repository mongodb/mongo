@section version_1131 Upgrading to Version 11.3.1
<dl>

<dt>Per-file configuration "huffman_value"</dt>
<dd>
Huffman encoding is no longer supported for values or keys (support for keys was removed
in a previous release).
</dd>

<dt>Connection configuration "checkpoint_cleanup"</dt>
<dd>
The checkpoint_cleanup configuration now uses a sub-configuration "method" to control
how aggressively obsolete content is removed when creating checkpoints:
"checkpoint_cleanup=[method=[none|reclaim_space]]"
</dd>

<dt>Connection configuration "verbose"</dt>
<dd>
Three eviction-related verbose config values ('evict', 'evict_stuck', and 'evictserver')
have been merged into the 'eviction' config.
</dd>

<dt>WT_SESSION.verify configuration "dump_app_data"</dt>
<dd>
The 'dump_app_data' configuration of the WT_SESSION.verify command has been renamed to
'dump_all_data'.
</dd>

<dt>WT_SESSION.set_timestamp configuration "oldest_timestamp" and "stable_timestamp"</dt>
<dd>
An invalid oldest_timestamp or stable_timestamp value is no longer silently ignored, and now
returns an error. The stable timestamp should always be greater than the oldest timestamp and
neither can be set to a value older than the current one.
</dd>

</dl> <hr>
@section version_1120 Upgrading to Version 11.2.0
<dl>

<dt>Connection configuration "operation_timeout_ms"</dt>
<dd>
The connection configuration "operation_timeout_ms" is now deprecated. The option is
still accepted in this version but will have no effect when set.
</dd>

<dt>Connection configuration "failpoint_eviction_fail_after_reconciliation"</dt>
<dd>
The connection configuration "failpoint_eviction_fail_after_reconciliation" has been
replaced by "failpoint_eviction_split".
</dd>

<dt>Cursor configuration "prefix_search"</dt>
<dd>
The cursor configuration "prefix_search" is now deprecated. The option is still accepted
in this version but will have no effect when set. Users should look into the new bound
cursor interface.
</dd>

<dt>Session API "flush_tier" function</dt>
<dd>
The session API "flush_tier" function is removed. Users of this function should move to
calling "checkpoint" with the "flush_tier" configuration specified.
</dd>

</dl> <hr>
@section version_1110 Upgrading to Version 11.1.0
<dl>

<dt>Connection configuration "debug mode"</dt>
<dd>
The connection configuration "debug_mode" (only used for testing) has had its
"flush_checkpoint" option removed.
</dd>

<dt>Connection configuration "timing_stress_for_test"</dt>
<dd>
The connection configuration "timing_stress_for_test" (only used for testing) has had
its "checkpoint_evict_page" option removed.
</dd>

<dt>Connection configuration "verbose"</dt>
<dd>
The verbose messaging system has had its range of debug options extended. The previous
"DEBUG" level now maps to "DEBUG_1", and will output significantly fewer messages. If you
want all of the same messages as the old "DEBUG" level, you'll need to use "DEBUG_5".
</dd>

@section version_1100 Upgrading to Version 11.0.0

The WiredTiger 11.0 release is a complete refresh of the WiredTiger storage engine.
Applications written to earlier versions of the WiredTiger API will require review
(although the API structure is substantially the same as previous releases). Applications
using row-store data objects can use those objects without change. Applications using
fixed- or variable-length column-store data objects will require a dump and reload cycle
to import those objects into a 11.0 release environment.
