/*! @page verbose_messaging Verbose messaging

As part of normal operation, WiredTiger will produce verbose messages
around various events, actions and possible issues/errors. Verbose
messages are spread across various categories, representing different sub-systems
throughout WiredTiger. Verbose messages can be usefully leveraged to monitor,
debug and diagnose events across WiredTiger's runtime.

@section verbosity_levels Verbosity Levels

WiredTiger associates a verbosity level with each message. The verbosity
level denotes the severity of a given message, ranging from high
severity error messages (\c ERROR) to low severity debug informational
messages (\c DEBUG_5). The full range of verbosity levels and their associated
meanings are:

<table>
@hrow{Level, Value, Description}
@row{\c ERROR, -3, Critical error conditions triggered in WiredTiger. Usually requiring a DB restart. }
@row{\c WARNING, -2, Warning conditions potentially signaling non-imminent errors and behaviors. Important to be aware of and useful for diagnosing potential error states. }
@row{\c NOTICE, -1, Messages for significant events in WiredTiger\, usually worth noting. Notice messages are associated with normal runtime operations i.e not produced from any state considered harmful or error-prone.}
@row{\c INFO, 0, Informational style messages\, usually describing statuses and actions performed by WiredTiger. }
@row{\c DEBUG_1, 1, Low severity messages\, useful for debugging purposes. }
@row{\c DEBUG_2, 2, Lower severity messages\, an increase in verbosity from \c DEBUG_1. }
@row{\c DEBUG_3, 3, Low severity messages. }
@row{\c DEBUG_4, 4, Low severity messages. }
@row{\c DEBUG_5, 5, Lowest severity messages. }
</table>

@section verbosity_categories Verbosity Categories

Each verbose message is associated with a category. Verbose categories represent a range of different
sub-systems in WiredTiger, where messages will denote a specific operation or event under a given sub-system.
To see the complete exhaustive list of available verbose categories, refer to the \c 'verbose' configuration option
under ::wiredtiger_open.

Each verbosity category can be individually configured with a verbosity level (as described in @ref verbosity_levels).
This allowing the end user to fine tune and tailor the verbosity of each category to fit their use case
e.g. configuring WiredTiger's runtime for debugging/monitoring a specific sub-system.

When a category is assigned a verbosity level, any associated message less than or equal to (\c <=) that level will be displayed.
As an example, configuring the \c checkpoint category with the \c DEBUG_1 verbosity level would display \c checkpoint related messages
less than or equal to the \c DEBUG_1 level.

\c DEBUG_1 is a reasonable starting point when debugging, with the higher debug levels being intended for cases where
\c DEBUG_1 does not provide enough information.

Any category that is not explicitly configured with a verbosity level will default to the \c NOTICE (\c -1) level, effectively masking
\c INFO and \c DEBUG_1 through \c DEBUG_5 informational messages.

@subsection verbosity_configuration Configuring Verbose Categories

Configuration of the verbose messaging system is achieved via the \c verbose configuration option when either
opening a wiredtiger connection (::wiredtiger_open) or re-configuring a wiredtiger connection (WT_CONNECTION::reconfigure).
The \c verbose configuration takes in a list of categories, where each category can be optionally associated with a verbosity level.
An example configuring a WiredTiger connection with verbosity enabled:

@snippet ex_verbose.c Configure verbose_messaging

In the above example:
- \c api is configured to the \c DEBUG_1 verbosity level.
- \c version is configured to the \c DEBUG_1 verbosity level. If a category is passed without a verbosity
level (e.g. \c <code>:0</code>), the category will default to the \c DEBUG_1 level (i.e. <code>verbose=[version]</code> is equivalent to <code>verbose=[version:1]</code>).
- \c write is configured to the \c INFO verbosity level.

When configuring verbosity levels, the lowest value the user can associate with a category is \c 0 (\c INFO). This ensuring
the lower verbosity levels, \c NOTICE (\c -1) and below, are unmasked. Messages with levels less than or equal to \c NOTICE are considered
to have important diagnostic information and thus should not be hidden.
