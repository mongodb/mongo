/*! @page build-posix Building and installing WiredTiger on POSIX (Linux, *BSD, OS X):

@section posix_github Building using Git and GitHub

Skip this step if you are building from a WiredTiger release package,
and proceed with @ref posix_building.

To build from the WiredTiger GitHub repository requires
<a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>,
<a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> and
<a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a> (if building to support the Python API).
We also suggest <a href="https://ninja-build.org/">Ninja</a> and
<a href="https://ccache.dev/">ccache</a> for improved incremental build times.

First, clone the repository:

@code
git clone git://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger.git
@endcode

Now proceed with @ref posix_building.

@section posix_building Building WiredTiger

To build the WiredTiger software on a POSIX system, change directory to
the top-level directory, then configure and create a new directory to run
your build from:

@code
cd wiredtiger
mkdir build
cd build
@endcode

Change into your newly created build directory and using CMake run the build configuration
step to generate your build.
@code
cmake ../.
# If using the Ninja build tool, you can additionally specify the generator '-G Ninja' to construct a
# ninja build i.e 'cmake -G Ninja ../.'.
@endcode

Lastly, in the same directory you configured your build, start the build:
@code
make
# Or 'ninja' if using the Ninja build tool.
@endcode

@section posix_installing Installing WiredTiger

The WiredTiger software consists of a library and a single standalone utility.

WiredTiger's distribution by default builds and installs the shared version library in <code>/usr/local/lib</code>.  For example:

@code
file /usr/local/lib/libwiredtiger*
/usr/local/lib/libwiredtiger.so.10.0.1: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, not stripped
/usr/local/lib/libwiredtiger.so:        symbolic link to `libwiredtiger.so.10.0.1'
@endcode

WiredTiger uses
<a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> to build and install the libraries.
By default, the shared libraries are built. To build only static
libraries, configure WiredTiger using the
\c -DENABLE_STATIC=1 argument.

In addition, WiredTiger installs a standalone utility program named
<code>wt</code>.  By default, this utility is installed in
<code>/usr/local/bin/wt</code>.

To install WiredTiger:

@code
make install
# Or 'ninja install' if using the Ninja build tool.
@endcode

To uninstall WiredTiger:

@code
xargs rm < install_manifest.txt
@endcode

The \c install_manifest.txt file is created when you run <code>ninja install</code>.

To install WiredTiger's libraries or binaries into alternate locations,
configure WiredTiger using the \c -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=custom_path argument.
For example, to install the libraries and binaries into a different location:

@code
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/c/wiredtiger -G Ninja ../.
@endcode

@section posix_configure Configuring WiredTiger

The WiredTiger software supports some additional configuration options:

@par \c -DHAVE_ATTACH=1
Configure WiredTiger to sleep and wait for a debugger to attach on failure.
<b>DO NOT</b> configure this option in production environments.

@par \c -DHAVE_DIAGNOSTIC=1
Configure WiredTiger to perform various run-time diagnostic tests.
<b>DO NOT</b> configure this option in production environments.

@par \c -DENABLE_LZ4=1
Configure WiredTiger for <a href="https://github.com/Cyan4973/lz4">LZ4</a>
compression; see @ref compression for more information.

@par \c -DENABLE_PYTHON=1
Build the WiredTiger <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> API;
requires <a href="http://swig.org">SWIG</a>.

@par \c -DENABLE_SNAPPY=1
Configure WiredTiger for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/snappy/">snappy</a>
compression; see @ref compression for more information.

@par \c -DENABLE_ZLIB=1
Configure WiredTiger for <a href="http://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a>
compression; see @ref compression for more information.

@par \c -DENABLE_ZSTD=1
Configure WiredTiger for <a href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd">Zstd</a>
compression; see @ref compression for more information.

@par \c -DWT_STANDALONE_BUILD=0
Configure WiredTiger to disable standalone build. Standalone build is enabled
by default.

@par \c -DHAVE_BUILTIN_EXTENSION_LZ4=1, \c -DHAVE_BUILTIN_EXTENSION_SNAPPY=1, \c -DHAVE_BUILTIN_EXTENSION_ZLIB=1, \c -DHAVE_BUILTIN_EXTENSION_ZSTD=1
Configure WiredTiger to include support for extensions in the main library.
This avoids requiring additional libraries for supported extensions. Currently
supported builtin options are for \c lz4, \c snappy, \c zlib and \c zstd.

@par <code>-DSPINLOCK_TYPE[=pthread, pthread_adaptive, gcc]</code>
Configure WiredTiger to use a specific mutex type for serialization;
options are \c pthread (the default, which configures WiredTiger to use
POSIX 1003.1c pthread mutexes), \c pthread_adaptive (which configures
WiredTiger to use POSIX 1003.1c pthread mutexes configured to be
adaptive (where that functionality is available), or \c gcc (which
configures WiredTiger to use gcc-based spinlocks).

@section posix_compiler Changing compiler or loader options

By default CMake will use your default system compiler (\c cc). If you want to use a specific toolchain you can pass a toolchain file. We have
provided a toolchain file for both GCC (\c cmake/toolchains/gcc.cmake) and Clang (\c cmake/toolchains/clang.cmake). To use either
toolchain you can pass the \c -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE= to the CMake configuration step. For example:

For example, to explicitly specify the GCC toolchain:

@code
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchains/gcc.cmake ../.
@endcode

To explicitly specify the Clang toolchain:

@code
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchains/clang.cmake ../.
@endcode

By default, WiredTiger builds with the \c -O3 compiler optimization flag
unless manually specified through the \c -DCC_OPTIMIZE_LEVEL configuration option. For example, to specify
a different level of optimization:

@code
cmake -DCC_OPTIMIZE_LEVEL=-O1 ../.
@endcode

@section posix_ctest Running WiredTiger C/C++ Tests

The WiredTiger CMake build makes available a suite of C/C++ based tests.
To run the available tests you can use our smoke test alias (\c check). Ensure you're in the build directory and execute:

@code
ctest -j$(nproc) -L check
@endcode

Alternatively to just run all the tests available:

@code
ctest -j$(nproc)
@endcode

In addition, to get verbose output with your test run you can use the \c -VV flag:

@code
ctest -j$(nproc) -VV
@endcode

If you want to focus on running a specific test (i.e. run a test that may be failing) you can use the \c -R flag:

@code
# Note: -R specifies a regex, where any matching test will be run
ctest -j$(nproc) -R test_name
@endcode
