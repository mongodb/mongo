/*! @page durability_checkpoint Checkpoint-level durability

WiredTiger supports checkpoint durability by default, and optionally
commit-level durability when logging is enabled.  In most applications,
commit-level durability impacts performance more than checkpoint
durability; checkpoints offer basic operation durability across
application or system failure without impacting performance (although
the creation of each checkpoint is a relatively heavy-weight operation).
See @ref durability_log for information on commit-level durability.

Checkpoints can be taken by the application via the WT_SESSION::checkpoint API.
Alternatively checkpoints can be taken automatically by WiredTiger by
providing the \c checkpoint configuration to
::wiredtiger_open. The frequency of automatic checkpoints is controlled by
two additional API settings: \c wait and \c log_size.
The \c wait setting defines the interval, in seconds, between the end of the current
checkpoint and the start of the next checkpoint. The \c log_size setting
instructs WiredTiger to take a checkpoint when the number of bytes written
to the log since the last checkpoint exceeds the size threshold. Both configurations
can be used at the same time and a checkpoint will be taken whenever either
threshold is met.  If using \c log_size to scheduled automatic checkpoints, we
recommend the size selected be a multiple of the physical size of the underlying log
file to more easily support automatic log file removal.

@section checkpoint_snapshot Checkpoints vs. snapshots

Here is a brief explanation of the terms "checkpoint" and "snapshot", as
they are widely used in this manual. A checkpoint is an on-disk entity that
captures the persistent state of some or all of the database, while a snapshot
is a lightweight in-memory entity that captures the current state of pending
updates in the cache. Isolation refers to snapshots, because isolation is about
runtime state and which updates can be seen by other threads' transactions
as they run. Durability refers to checkpoints, because durability is about
on-disk persistence.  The two concepts are closely connected, of course;
when a checkpoint is created the code involved uses a snapshot to determine
which updates should and should not appear in the checkpoint.

@section checkpoint_checkpoints Checkpoints

A checkpoint is automatically created for each individual file whenever the last
reference to a modified data source is closed.

Checkpoints of the entire database can be explicitly created with the
WT_SESSION::checkpoint method. Automatic database-wide checkpoints can be
scheduled based on elapsed time or data size with the ::wiredtiger_open \c
checkpoint configuration. In this mode of operation, an internal server thread
is created to perform these checkpoints.

All transactional updates committed before a checkpoint are made durable
by the checkpoint, therefore the frequency of checkpoints limits the
volume of data that may be lost due to application or system failure.

Data sources that are involved in an exclusive operation when the checkpoint
starts, including bulk load or salvage, will be skipped by the checkpoint.

When a data source is first opened, it appears in the same state it was
in when it was most recently checkpointed. In other words, updates after
the most recent checkpoint (for example, in the case of failure), will not
appear in the data source at checkpoint-level durability.  If no checkpoint
is found when the data source is opened, the data source will appear empty.

@section checkpoint_cursors Checkpoint cursors

Cursors are normally opened in the live version of a data source.
However, it is also possible to open a read-only, static view of the
data source as of a checkpoint.
This is done by passing the \c checkpoint configuration string to
WT_SESSION::open_cursor. Checkpoint cursors can only be opened on application
named checkpoints or on the latest checkpoint using "WiredTigerCheckpoint".
This provides a limited form of time-travel, as the static
view is not changed by subsequent checkpoints and will persist until
the checkpoint cursor is closed.
Checkpoint cursors ignore the currently running transaction; they are (in a
sense) their own transactions.
When timestamps are in use, a checkpoint cursor reads at the time
associated with the checkpoint, which is normally the stable timestamp
as of the time the checkpoint was taken.

@section checkpoint_naming Checkpoint naming

Checkpoints may optionally be given names by the application.
Checkpoints named by the application persist until explicitly
discarded or replaced with a new checkpoint by the same name.  (If an
application attempts to replace an existing checkpoint, and it cannot be
removed, either because a cursor is reading from the previous checkpoint, or
because backups are in progress, the new checkpoint will fail and the previous
checkpoint will remain.) Because named checkpoints persist until discarded or
replaced, they can be used to save the state of the data for later use.

Internal checkpoints, that is, checkpoints not named by the application, use the
reserved name \c WiredTigerCheckpoint. (All checkpoint names beginning with this
string are reserved.) Applications can open the most recent checkpoint (whether
internal or named) by specifying \c WiredTigerCheckpoint as the checkpoint name to
WT_SESSION::open_cursor.

The name "all" is also reserved as it is used when dropping checkpoints.

\warning
Applications wanting a consistent view of the data in two separate tables must
either use named checkpoints or explicitly control when checkpoints are taken,
as there is a race between opening the default checkpoints in two different
tables and a checkpoint operation replacing the default checkpoint in one of
those tables.

The \c -c option to the \c wt command line utility \c list command will list a
data source's checkpoints, with time stamp, in a human-readable format.

@section checkpoint_backup Checkpoint durability and backups

Backups are done using backup cursors (see @ref backup for more information).

\warning
When applications are using checkpoint-level durability, checkpoints taken
while a backup cursor is open are not durable. That is, if a crash occurs
when a backup cursor is open, then the system will be restored to the most
recent checkpoint prior to the opening of the backup cursor, even if later
database checkpoints were completed. As soon as the backup cursor is closed,
the system will again be restored to the most recent checkpoint taken.

Applications using commit-level durability retain durability via the write-ahead
log even though checkpoints taken while a backup cursor is open are not durable.
All log files are retained once the backup cursor is opened and, in the event of
a crash, all operations will be replayed to provide durability.

@section checkpoint_compaction Checkpoints and file compaction

Checkpoints share file blocks, and dropping a checkpoint may or may not
make file blocks available for re-use, depending on whether the dropped
checkpoint contained the last reference to those file blocks.  Because named
checkpoints are not discarded until explicitly discarded or replaced, they may
prevent WT_SESSION::compact from reducing file size due to shared file blocks.
