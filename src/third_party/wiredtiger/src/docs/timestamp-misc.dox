@section timestamp_read_roundup Rounding up the read timestamp

Applications setting timestamps for a transaction have to comply with the
constraints based on the global timestamp state. In order to be compliant with
the constraints, applications will need to query the global timestamp state,
check their timestamps for compliance, and adjust timestamps if required.
To reduce application burden, WiredTiger supports automatic timestamp rounding
in some scenarios.

Applications can configure <code>roundup_timestamps=(read=true)</code>
with the WT_SESSION::begin_transaction method.  Configuring
<code>roundup_timestamps=(read=true)</code> causes the read timestamp to be
rounded up to the oldest timestamp. If the read timestamp is greater than
the oldest timestamp no change will be made.

@section timestamp_misc_rts Using rollback-to-stable with timestamps

Applications can explicitly roll back the system to a specific stable timestamp
by calling the WT_CONNECTION::rollback_to_stable method. Applications must first
set the \c stable timestamp using WT_CONNECTION::set_timestamp and then call
WT_CONNECTION::rollback_to_stable, which will discard all updates to
checkpoint-durable tables that have commit timestamps more recent than the set
stable timestamp.

Logged tables and updates made without an associated commit timestamp are
unaffected.

The database must be quiescent during this process, and applications must close
or reset all open cursors before calling the WT_CONNECTION::rollback_to_stable
method.

@section timestamp_misc_diagnostic Using diagnostic configurations to enforce timestamp usage

The WT_SESSION::create method supports additional checking of timestamp
usage on a per-key or per-table basis. While these usage checks can decrease
application performance, and applications may not choose to configure them
in production settings, they are strongly recommended during development.

Setting the \c write_timestamp_usage configuration specifies how timestamps
are expected to be used by the table:

| Configuration | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| always | Require all updates to the table have a commit timestamp. |
| never | Require no updates to the table have a commit timestamp. |
| ordered | Allow updates both with and without a commit timestamp, but once a commit timestamp is used when updating a key in the table, all future updates to the key require a commit timestamp as well; each update must have a commit timestamp after the previous update. |
| mixed_mode | Allow updates both with and without a commit timestamp; each update must have a commit timestamp after the previous update, or no timestamp at all. |

The \c write_timestamp_usage configuration is expected to be used
with the WT_SESSION::create method's \c assert configuration. The
\c "assert(read_timestamp)" configuration requires timestamps always or never
be used on reads in the table. The \c "assert(write_timestamp)" configuration
requires update timestamps conform to the \c write_timestamp_usage setting. If
WiredTiger detects a violation of the configured policy, an error message
will be logged. Additionally, in diagnostic builds, the library
will fail and drop core at the failing check.

\warning
These are best-effort checks by WiredTiger, and there are cases where
application misbehavior will not be detected.

@section timestamp_misc_reset_snapshot Resetting the snapshot

Transactions that have not set \c read_timestamp can use
WT_SESSION::reset_snapshot with timestamped tables as with
non-timestamped tables, to get a new snapshot of the database to read
from. See @ref snapshot_reset.
Transactions that have set \c read_timestamp can also call
WT_SESSION::reset_snapshot, but it will have no effect.

@section timestamps_misc_in_memory In-memory configurations and timestamps

Timestamps are supported for in-memory databases, but must be configured as in
ordinary databases, and the same APIs are used in both cases for historical
reasons. By default, in-memory database objects behave like commit-level
objects in ordinary databases, that is, timestamps are ignored. If logging
is disabled for the object, using the \c "log=(enabled=false)" configuration,
then the timestamps will not be ignored and will behave as with objects in
ordinary databases where logging has been disabled.
