@subpage devdoc-glossary

WiredTiger assigns specific meanings to certain words. Here we decode them.

@subpage devdoc-schema

Most applications begin to make use of WiredTiger by creating a table (or other
data object) to store their data in. Create is one of several schema operations
available in WiredTiger.

@subpage devdoc-dhandle-lifecycle

An internal structure called Data Handle (dhandle) is used to represent and
access a table in WiredTiger. A dhandle gets created when a table is accessed
for the first time. It is kept in a global list and is shared across the
sessions.  When a dhandle is not needed anymore and has been idle for a while,
it is closed and destroyed, releasing all the resources associated with it.

@subpage devdoc-statistics

WiredTiger can generate statistics that are useful for providing information
necessary when performance tuning your WiredTiger application. Here we focus
on analyzing and reviewing the data generated by the statistics logging
functionality.

@subpage devdoc-optrack

The purpose of operation tracking is to visualize WiredTiger's execution so
that correlations between performance anomalies are easily spotted. This
operation tracking tutorial provides a general overview of operation tracking
and describes ways to visualize the data in fine detail.

@subpage devdoc-perf

Linux `perf` is a tool that allows counting and sampling of various events in
the hardware and in the kernel. Hardware events are available via performance
monitoring units (PMU); they measure CPU cycles, cache misses, branches, etc.
Kernel events include scheduling context switches, page faults and block I/O.
Here we provide a quick cheat sheet of how to use `perf` with WiredTiger.

@subpage devdoc-xray

XRay is a tool, originally developed at Google and now integrated in LLVM, that
instruments the program such that when it runs it produces a trace of executed
functions and their timestamps. This article explains how to instrument
WiredTiger, collect the XRay traces, and analyze them.

@subpage devdoc-perf-flamegraphs

Why is my CPU busy? FlameGraphs help visually summarize on-CPU call stacks and
allow for the quick identification of hot code paths. Here we explain how to
generate FlameGraphs from WiredTiger `perf` data.
