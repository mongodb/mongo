/*! @page transactions_api Transactional API calls

Operations in WiredTiger are inherently transactional and durable when the table
is closed, so the checkpoint durability model of making an application
transactional and its data durable only requires:

- Optionally grouping operations into explicit transactions,
- Optionally adding checkpoint calls for additional durability points.

@section transactions_grouping Explicit transactions

An explicit transaction is a transaction that starts with a begin transaction
operation and ends with either a commit transaction or rollback transaction
operation. Any operation having multiple related updates should be enclosed in
an explicit transaction to ensure the updates are applied atomically.

In WiredTiger, transaction operations are methods of the WT_SESSION class.

Applications call WT_SESSION::begin_transaction to start a new transaction.
Operations subsequently performed using that WT_SESSION handle, including
operations on any cursors open in that WT_SESSION handle (whether opened before
or after the WT_SESSION::begin_transaction call), are part of the transaction.
The transaction is committed by calling WT_SESSION::commit_transaction.  The
effects may be discarded by calling WT_SESSION::rollback_transaction. If
WT_SESSION::commit_transaction returns any error, the transaction was rolled
back, not committed.

A data operation executed within a transaction can fail if it conflicts with an
operation in another concurrently running transaction.  (A conflict occurs
between two operations when letting both of them continue would lead to a
violation of consistency or isolation.) Failures of this form produce the error
::WT_ROLLBACK. If this error occurs, the application should roll back its
current transaction using WT_SESSION::rollback_transaction, and either abandon
the operation or retry the entire operation by starting a new transaction.

After a transaction is successfully committed, cursors in the session retain
their position, as well as any currently set keys or values they may have.
If a transaction is rolled back for any reason, cursors in the session are
reset (as if the WT_CURSOR::reset method was called), discarding any cursor
position as well as any currently set keys or values.

@snippet ex_all.c transaction commit/rollback

@section transactions_implicit Implicit transactions

While any operation consisting of multiple related updates should be enclosed in
an explicit transaction to ensure the updates are applied atomically, it is not
necessary to start explicit transactions for single operations.  If no explicit
transaction is started, each update operation is automatically committed before
it returns.

If an implicit transaction successfully commits, the cursors in the WT_SESSION::
remain positioned.  If an implicit transaction fails, it is rolled back, and
all cursors in the
WT_SESSION:: are reset discarding any position or key/value information they may
have.

@section transactions_concurrency Concurrency control

WiredTiger uses optimistic concurrency control algorithms.  Writes do not block
other writes, although concurrent transactions updating the same value will fail with
::WT_ROLLBACK.  Some applications may benefit from application-level
synchronization to avoid repeated attempts to update and then roll back the same
value.

Both read and write transactions may fail with the ::WT_ROLLBACK error if a
resource cannot be allocated. For example, if cache resources cannot be
allocated to hold the data required to satisfy transactional readers, operations
may fail and return ::WT_ROLLBACK.

\warning
As read transactions rarely fail, application developers may neglect to correctly
handle a read transaction return of ::WT_ROLLBACK. Applications must be written
to anticipate read failure.

@section isolation_levels Isolation levels

@copydoc doc_isolation_levels

Snapshot isolation is recommended in almost all situations, and
all updates must be performed using snapshot isolation. Only read operations may
be performed at lower isolation levels. In cases where greater read performance
is more important than exact consistency, or loss of consistency is acceptable,
it can make sense to use a weaker isolation model.  If you are unfamiliar with
isolation levels in general, or for detailed descriptions of these models, see
@ref explain_isolation.

The transaction isolation level can be configured on a per-transaction basis.

@snippet ex_all.c transaction isolation

Additionally, the default isolation level for all transactions can be configured
and re-configured on a per-session basis:

@snippet ex_all.c session isolation configuration

@snippet ex_all.c session isolation re-configuration

@section cursors_transactions Cursors and transactions

If there is a transaction active in a session, cursors operate in the context of
that transaction.  Reads performed while a transaction is active operate at the
isolation level of the transaction, and updates performed within a transaction
are made durable by calling WT_SESSION::commit_transaction, or discarded by
calling WT_SESSION::rollback_transaction.

If no transaction is active, cursor reads are performed at the isolation level
of the session, set with the \c isolation configuration key to
WT_CONNECTION::open_session, and successful updates are automatically committed
before the update operation completes.

At \c read-committed isolation, committed changes from concurrent transactions
become visible only when no cursor is positioned.  In other words, at this
isolation level, all cursors in a session read from a stable snapshot while any
cursor in the session remains positioned.  A call to WT_CURSOR::next or
WT_CURSOR::prev on a positioned cursor will not update the snapshot.

At \c snapshot isolation when using implicit transactions, the same behavior
applies for reads: when a read is performed, a snapshot is taken, and
all cursors will read from that snapshot as long
as any cursor remains positioned or until a write operation is performed.
Further reads after that point (or a call to WT_SESSION::reset_snapshot) will
acquire a new snapshot.

<!--
XXX:
The last two paragraphs are not at all clear.
-->

Cursor positions survive transaction boundaries, unless a transaction is rolled
back. If a transaction is rolled back for any reason (either implicitly because
WT_SESSION::commit_transaction failed, or explicitly because the application
called WT_SESSION::rollback_transaction), all cursors in the session are reset
as if the WT_CURSOR::reset method was called, discarding any cursor position as
well as any key and value that may have been set.

@section snapshot_reset Resetting the session snapshot

Snapshot-isolation transactions can pin large amounts of data into the database
cache in order to be able to satisfy potential reads at the snapshot.
WT_SESSION::reset_snapshot releases the current snapshot and gets a new (more
recent) snapshot to avoid pinning content in the cache that is no longer needed.
It is an error to call WT_SESSION::reset_snapshot at any isolation level other
than snapshot, or if the current transaction has performed any write operations.

\warning
Applications not using read timestamps for search may see different results
after the snapshot is updated.
