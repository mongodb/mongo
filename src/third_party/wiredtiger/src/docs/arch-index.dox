/*! @page arch-index WiredTiger Architecture Guide

The WiredTiger Architecture Guide provides a comprehensive overview
of WiredTiger internals and code that should be useful for any database
engineer wanting to understand how the storage engine works. The goal
of this guide is to help both MongoDB engineers and external users
quickly understand the workings of WiredTiger.

The relationships between the software components in WiredTiger are
illustrated in the diagram below. An arrow originating at Component A
and pointing to Component B indicates that Component B is used by
Component A.

' We add spacing to the diagram in places to influence the layout.
' To do this, we create some invisible components with hidden arrows
' pointing to them.  Since we don't otherwise use the "file" component,
' we set all its parts to be transparent, and any use of "file" results
' in an invisible spacer whose width is directed by the length of its label.
' When modifying this diagram, it's sometimes useful to comment out the
' following lines, and any [hidden] directives used below, to see how
' the spacers influence the layout.  Note that this may be fragile;
' the spacers give hints to the layout, such hints will not always be honored.

' with most nesting within the "engine" rectangle.

For those unfamiliar with storage engine architecture and/or seeking an introduction
to WiredTiger, we recommend reading the guide in the order presented. You can find
much of the architecture-specific terminology explained in the @ref arch-glossary.
For an application level view of WiredTiger, head over to the @ref basic_api section
of the documentation.

/*! @page arch-toc-fundamentals Fundamentals

@subpage arch-connection
- A connection is a handle to a WiredTiger database instance.

@subpage arch-session
- A session defines the context for most operations performed in WiredTiger.

@subpage arch-cursor
- Cursors are used to get and modify data.

@subpage arch-transaction
- Transactions provide a powerful abstraction for multiple threads to
operate on data concurrently.

@subpage arch-timestamp
- Timestamping and the timestamped data model is a facility for
supporting distributed applications.

@subpage arch-snapshot
- Snapshots are implemented by storing transaction ids committed before
the transaction started.

@subpage arch-rts
- Rollback the database to a stable state by removing data that is beyond the
stable timestamp.

/*! @page arch-toc-data-org Data Organization

@subpage arch-schema

A schema defines the format of the application data in WiredTiger.

@subpage arch-metadata

Metadata is stored as <code>uri, config</code> key/value pairs in a designated table.

*/

/*! @page arch-toc-data-src Data Sources

@subpage arch-btree

A B-Tree is one type of underlying data source in a dhandle and is organized into pages.

@subpage arch-dhandle

An internal structure called a Data Handle (dhandle) is used to represent and
access Btrees and other data sources in WiredTiger.

@subpage arch-row-column

Row stores and column store are B-Trees. Row stores have a variable size key
and data while column stores have as their key a record id.

*/

/*! @page arch-toc-in-mem In Memory Concepts

@subpage arch-cache

Cache is represented by the various shared data structures that
make up in-memory Btrees and subordinate data structures.

@subpage arch-eviction

Eviction represents the process or removing old data from the cache,
writing it to disk if it is dirty.

*/

/*! @page arch-toc-mem-disk Moving Data Between Memory and Disk

@subpage arch-block

The block manager manages the reading and writing of disk blocks.

@subpage arch-data-file

The format of the data file is given by structures in \c block.h .

*/

/*! @page arch-toc-on-disk On Disk Concepts

@subpage arch-checkpoint

A checkpoint is created by WiredTiger to serve as a point from which it can recover.

@subpage arch-hs

The History Store tracks old versions of records.

@subpage arch-backup

Hot backup uses a type of cursor to backup the database.

@subpage arch-compact

Compaction process can be used to reclaim unused space from on-disk files.

*/

/*! @page arch-toc-recovery Recovery

@subpage arch-logging

WiredTiger writes all changes into a write-ahead log when configured.

@subpage arch-log-file

The format of a log file is defined in \c log.h .

*/

/*! @page arch-toc-tools Tools

@subpage arch-python

WiredTiger has a Python API that is useful for scripting and experimentation.

@subpage command_line

The \c wt tool is a command-line utility that provides access to various pieces
of the WiredTiger functionality.

*/

/*! @page arch-toc-platform Cross-Platform Support

@subpage arch-fs-os

A layer of abstraction is above all operating system calls and
a set of functions can be registered to be called for each file system
operation.
