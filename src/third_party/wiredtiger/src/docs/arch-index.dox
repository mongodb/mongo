/*! @page arch-index WiredTiger Architecture Guide

WiredTiger is built as a library that is linked into the application.  Applications
use the API interface to direct WiredTiger's operations (see @ref basic_api).
Here is an overview of the software components in WiredTiger and how they are organized.
An arrow indicates the "from" component uses "to" component.

' We add spacing to the diagram in places to influence the layout.
' To do this, we create some invisible components with hidden arrows
' pointing to them.  Since we don't otherwise use the "file" component,
' we set all its parts to be transparent, and any use of "file" results
' in an invisible spacer whose width is directed by the length of its label.
' When modifying this diagram, it's sometimes useful to comment out the
' following lines, and any [hidden] directives used below, to see how
' the spacers influence the layout.  Note that this may be fragile;
' the spacers give hints to the layout, such hints will not always be honored.

' Our diagram is simple.  First, we define lots of labeled rectangles
' with most nesting within the "engine" rectangle.

We go into some detail for some of the internal components.

@subpage arch-backup "Backup"

Hot backup uses a type of cursor to backup the database.

@subpage arch-block "Block Manager"

The Block Manager manages the reading and writing of disk blocks.

@subpage arch-btree

A B-Tree is one type of underlying data source in a dhandle and is organized into pages.

@subpage arch-cache

Cache is represented by the various shared data structures that
make up in-memory Btrees and subordinate data structures.

@subpage arch-checkpoint "Checkpoint"

A checkpoint is created by WiredTiger to serve as a point from which it can recover.

@subpage arch-connection "Connection"

A connection is a handle to a WiredTiger database instance.

@subpage arch-cursor "Cursor"

Cursors are used to get and modify data.

@subpage arch-data-file "Data File Format"

The format of the data file is given by structures in \c block.h .

@subpage arch-dhandle "Data Handles"

An internal structure called a Data Handle (dhandle) is used to represent and
access Btrees and other data sources in WiredTiger.

@subpage arch-eviction "Eviction"

Eviction represents the process or removing old data from the cache,
writing it to disk if it is dirty.

@subpage arch-fs-os "File System and Operating System Interface"

A layer of abstraction is above all operating system calls and
a set of functions can be registered to be called for each file system
operation.

@subpage arch-hs "History Store"

The History Store tracks old versions of records.

@subpage arch-logging "Logging"

WiredTiger writes all changes into a write-ahead log when configured.

@subpage arch-log-file "Log File Format"

The format of a log file is defined in \c log.h .

@subpage arch-metadata "Metadata"

Metadata is stored as <code>uri, config</code> K/V pairs in a designated table.

@subpage arch-python "Python API"

WiredTiger has a Python API that is useful for scripting and experimentation.

@subpage arch-row-column "Row Store and Column Store"

Row stores and column store are B-Trees. Row stores have a variable size key and data while column
stores have as their key a record id.

@subpage arch-rts "Rollback to Stable"

Rollback to stable to remove the unstable updates from the database.

@subpage arch-schema "Schema"

A schema defines the format of the application data in WiredTiger.

@subpage arch-session "Session"

A session defines the context for most operations performed in WiredTiger.

@subpage arch-snapshot "Snapshot"

Snapshots are implemented by storing transaction ids committed before
the transaction started.

@subpage arch-transaction "Transactions"

Transactions provide a powerful abstraction for multiple threads to operate on data concurrently.

@subpage arch-glossary

WiredTiger assigns specific meanings to certain words. Here we decode them.
