@page testing WiredTiger testing

WiredTiger uses a combination of several different tools and test
programs for testing WiredTiger.

WiredTiger testing is done automatically using the <a
href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> continuous integration testing
framework.  This allows us to be confident we don't introduce problems
in a non-standard configuration, or performance regressions.

@section test_suite Unit Test Suite

WiredTiger's primary functionality and regression testing is done in a
Python unit test suite (found in the source tree under \c test/suite).

The WiredTiger Python test suite includes approximately 10,000 separate
tests which are run on all platforms supported by WiredTiger.  Each test
is intended to test a single operation in a reproducible way, making it
easy to diagnose errors.  The test suite runs multiple test cases in
parallel, allowing it to be run in a relatively short period of time.

The WiredTiger unit test suite includes tests that cover:
- WiredTiger functionality (for example, cursors, transactions and recovery),
- Combinations of WiredTiger's configuration settings and APIs,
- Bug regression tests.

The WiredTiger Python test suite is built using the WiredTiger Python
API and the Python unittest functionality (the test suite requires at
least Python version 2.6).

The WiredTiger test suite automatically runs as part of every commit
into the WiredTiger GitHub source tree.

@section testing_performance Performance Testing

Performance testing is primarily done using the \c bench/wtperf utility.
A variety of database configurations are run based on the scripts in \c
bench/wtperf/runners.

WiredTiger performance tests are automatically run as part of each
commit into the \c develop branch of the WiredTiger GitHub source tree
and compared against previous runs to detect performance regressions.

@section testing_stress Stress Testing

Stress testing is primarily done using the \c test/format utility.  This
test program randomly configures a database and then runs some number
of randomly selected operations, using some number of randomly selected
threads, on that database.  WiredTiger stress testing is run continuously
on the WiredTiger GitHub \c develop branch.

@section testing_threads Concurrency testing

Concurrency testing is primarily done using the \c test/format utility.
Additionally, the \c test/thread and \c test/fops test utilities test
specific heavily threaded operations.  WiredTiger concurrency testing
is run continuously on the WiredTiger GitHub \c develop branch.

@section testing_static Static analysis

WiredTiger static analysis is done using three tools:

- The <a href="https://www.coverity.com/">Coverity,
Inc.</a>software analysis tool; current results and historic defect
reports are available at <a
href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/1018">Coverity's WiredTiger
page</a>.

- The Gimpel Software <a
href="http://www.gimpel.com/html/flex.htm">FlexeLint</a> implementation
of the UNIX lint tool.

- The University of Illinois LLVM project's <a
href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/">Clang Static Analyzer</a>.
