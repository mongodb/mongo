/*! @page explain_acid Tutorial: transactions and ACID properties

Transactions provide a powerful abstraction for multiple threads to
operate on data concurrently because they have the following properties:

- Atomicity: all or none of a transaction is completed.
- Consistency: if each transaction maintains some property when considered
  separately, then the combined effect of executing the transactions
  concurrently will maintain the same property.
- Isolation: every execution of a transaction is equivalent to one
  that runs single-threaded.
- Durability: once a transaction is fully complete, changes it made
  cannot be lost.

These properties greatly simplify the reasoning required for
writing concurrent applications.
Developers can reason about transactions as if they run
single-threaded and independently.

When the data operations in a transaction are complete, the
application will normally <i>commit</i> it.
This causes it to "take effect".
In keeping with the atomicity property, a transaction that fails
during execution, or that fails to commit due to a conflict with
another running transaction, is then <i>aborted</i> and any changes
it may have made are rolled back.
