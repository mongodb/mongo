/*! @page timestamp_txn_api Managing the transaction timestamp state

Individual transactions also have timestamp state. These timestamps are queried
using WT_SESSION::query_timestamp but are potentially set in a variety of
methods to allow configuration at various stages of the transaction:
WT_SESSION::begin_transaction, WT_SESSION::commit_transaction,
WT_SESSION::prepare_transaction and WT_SESSION::timestamp_transaction.

Applications will focus on two transactional timestamps: the read timestamp and the
commit timestamp. Without a read timestamp, reads will occur based on the transaction's
snapshot, which will include the latest values as of when the snapshot is taken.
With a read timestamp, reads will occur as of the specified time.

The transaction's commit timestamp is the time at which the transaction takes
effect. This is the time at which other transactions, with appropriately set
read timestamps, will see the transaction's writes instead of any previous
value. Applications can also set commit timestamps on a per-update basis in
a single transaction, in which case the commit timestamp is the time of the
visibility of the effected updates.

@section timestamp_txn_api_configure Application timestamp configuration

The WT_SESSION::create method's \c "assert=(read_timestamp)" configuration
checks that timestamps always or never be used on reads in the table.

By default, WiredTiger requires commit timestamps be used in "ordered" mode:
updates to a table can be made both with and without a commit timestamp,
but once a commit timestamp is used to update a key, all future updates to
the key require a commit timestamp. Further, each update to a key must have
a commit timestamp at or after the previous commit timestamp.

Updating a key without a commit timestamp creates a value that has "always
existed" and is visible regardless of timestamp. This makes sense when
loading initial data into an object, but once timestamps are used to update
a particular value, subsequent updates will normally also have a commit
timestamp. Similarly, because implicit transactions have no associated
timestamp, implicit transactions are generally only useful until timestamps
have been used to update a table.

These requirements can be changed on a per-table basis, to specify no updates
to a table have timestamps, with the WT_SESSION::create method's
\c "write_timestamp_usage=(never)" configuration.

These requirements can be changed on a per-transaction basis, to permit updates
without timestamps, after a key has already been updated using a timestamp,
with the WT_SESSION::begin_transaction method's \c no_timestamp configuration.
Updating a key without a commit timestamp, after making updates with a commit
timestamp, will discard all prior historical values, and future reads will
read the new value regardless of read timestamp. In other words, readers
with already acquired snapshots will see prior historical values based
on their timestamps. Readers acquiring a snapshot after the commit of the
update without a timestamp will not see prior historical values regardless
of their read timestamps.

There are additional timestamp usage checks in diagnostic builds.
Building in diagnostic mode to enable these usage checks will decrease
application performance. While applications should not configure diagnostic
builds for production use, they are strongly recommended during development.

If WiredTiger detects a violation of timestamp policy, an error message
will be logged and the transaction commit will fail. In diagnostic builds,
the library will log an error message and drop core at the failing check.

\warning
These are best-effort checks by WiredTiger, and there are cases where
application misbehavior will not be detected.

@section timestamp_txn_api_commit_timestamp Setting the transaction's commit timestamp

The \c commit time is the time at which other transactions with appropriately set
read timestamps will see the transaction's updates.

The commit timestamp can be set at any point in the transaction's lifecycle.
For prepared transactions, however, it can only be set after the transaction
has been successfully prepared.

\warning Commit (and prepare) timestamps must not be set in the past
of any read timestamp
that has ever been used. This rule is enforced by assertions in diagnostic
builds, but if applications violate this rule in non-diagnostic builds, data
consistency can be violated.
Similarly, because reading without a read timestamp reads the latest
values for all keys, one must not commit into the past of such a
transaction.

Applications using timestamps usually specify a timestamp to the
WT_SESSION::commit_transaction method to set the commit time for all updates in
the transaction.

For prepared transactions, the commit timestamp must not be before the prepare
timestamp. Otherwise, the commit timestamp must be after the stable timestamp.

@section timestamp_txn_api_commit_multi_timestamp Setting multiple commit timestamps

Applications may set different commit timestamps for different updates in a
single transaction by calling WT_SESSION::timestamp_transaction repeatedly to
set a new commit timestamp between updates in the transaction.  Each new commit
timestamp is applied to any subsequent updates. This gives applications the
ability to commit updates that take effect at different times;
that is, it is possible to create chains of updates where each
update appears at a different time to readers.  For transactions that set
multiple commit timestamps, the first commit timestamp set is also required to
be the earliest: the second and subsequent commit timestamps may not be
earlier than the first commit timestamp.  This feature is not compatible with
prepared transactions, which must use only a single commit timestamp.

This functionality is generally available as a mechanism to allow an optimized
implementation of re-creating a timestamp view of a data set. For example, in
a MongoDB replica set, content is generated on one node where transactions are
assigned a single commit timestamp, that content is re-created on each other
member in a replica set. When re-creating the content multiple changes from
the original node are batched together into a single WiredTiger transaction.

@section timestamp_txn_api_read_timestamp Setting the transaction's read timestamp

Setting the transaction's read timestamp causes a transaction to not see any
commits with a newer timestamp. (Updates may still conflict with commits having
a newer timestamp, of course.),

The read timestamp may be set to any time equal to or after the system's
\c oldest timestamp.

This restriction is enforced and applications can rely on an error return to
detect attempts to set the read timestamp older than the \c oldest timestamp.

The read timestamp may only be set once in the lifetime of a transaction.

@section timestamp_txn_api_query Querying transaction timestamp information

The following table lists the timestamps that can be queried using
WT_SESSION::query_timestamp. In all cases, a timestamp of 0 is returned
if the timestamp is not available or has not been set, for example, the
\c commit timestamp if no commit timestamp has been set.

| Timestamp | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| commit | the transaction's most recently set commit timestamp |
| first_commit | the transaction's first/earliest set commit timestamp |
| prepare | the timestamp used to prepare the transaction |
| read | the timestamp at which the transaction is reading |

@section timestamp_txn_api_begin Configuring transaction timestamp information with WT_SESSION::begin_transaction

The following table lists the transaction's timestamps and behaviors that can be set when the transaction begins, using WT_SESSION::begin_transaction:

@section timestamp_txn_api_commit Configuring transaction timestamp information with WT_SESSION::commit_transaction
