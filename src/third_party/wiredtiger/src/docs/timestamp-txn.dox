/*! @page timestamp_txn_api Managing the transaction timestamp state

Individual transactions also have timestamp state. These timestamps are queried
using WT_SESSION::query_timestamp but are potentially set in a variety of
methods to allow configuration at various stages of the transaction:
WT_SESSION::begin_transaction, WT_SESSION::commit_transaction,
WT_SESSION::prepare_transaction and WT_SESSION::timestamp_transaction.

Applications will focus on two transactional timestamps: the read timestamp and the
commit timestamp. Without a read timestamp, reads will occur based on the transaction's
snapshot, which will include the latest values as of when the snapshot is taken.
With a read timestamp, reads will occur as of the specified time.

The transaction's commit timestamp is the time at which the transaction takes
effect. This is the time at which other transactions, with appropriately set
read timestamps, will see the transaction's writes instead of any previous
value. Applications can also set commit timestamps on a per-update basis in
a single transaction, in which case the commit timestamp is the time of the
visibility of the effected updates.

Updating a key without a commit timestamp creates a value that has "always
existed" and is visible regardless of timestamp. This makes sense when
loading initial data into an object or in applications wishing to clear
historic values, but once timestamps are used to update a particular value,
subsequent updates will likely also use a commit timestamp. Updating a key
with a commit timestamp and then subsequently updating it without a commit
timestamp will discard all prior historical values, and future reads will
read the new value regardless of read timestamp. In other words, readers
with already acquired snapshots will see prior historical values based
on their timestamps. Readers acquiring a snapshot after the commit of the
update without a timestamp will not see prior historical values regardless
of their read timestamps.

@section timestamp_txn_api_configure Enforcing application timestamp behavior

Enforcing application timestamp behavior (for example, requiring updates to a
single data item appear in timestamp order), can be challenging for application
writers. WiredTiger includes diagnostic support for many common restrictions;
see @ref timestamp_misc_diagnostic.

@section timestamp_txn_api_query Querying transaction timestamp information

The following table lists the timestamps that can be queried using
WT_SESSION::query_timestamp:

| Timestamp | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| commit | the transaction's most recently set commit timestamp |
| first_commit | the transaction's first/earliest set commit timestamp |
| prepare | the timestamp used to prepare the transaction |
| read | the timestamp at which the transaction is reading |

In all cases, ::WT_NOTFOUND is returned if there is no matching timestamp.

@section timestamp_txn_api_begin Configuring transaction timestamp information with WT_SESSION::begin_transaction

The following table lists the transaction's timestamps and behaviors that can be set when the transaction begins, using WT_SESSION::begin_transaction:

| Timestamp | Constraint |  Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| read_timestamp | >= oldest | the transaction's read timestamp, see @ref timestamp_txn_api_read_timestamp for details |
| roundup_timestamps | None | boolean setting for timestamp auto-adjustments, see @ref timestamp_prepare_roundup and @ref timestamp_read_roundup for details |

@section timestamp_txn_api_commit Configuring transaction timestamp information with WT_SESSION::commit_transaction

The following table lists the transaction's timestamps that can be set when the
transaction commits, using WT_SESSION::commit_transaction:

| Timestamp | Constraint | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| commit_timestamp | > stable and >= prepare and >= any system read timestamp | the transaction's commit timestamp, see @ref timestamp_txn_api_commit_timestamp for details |
| durable_timestamp | >= commit | the transaction's durable timestamp, only applicable to prepared transactions, see @ref timestamp_prepare for details |

@section timestamp_txn_api_prepare Configuring transaction timestamp information with WT_SESSION::prepare_transaction

The following table lists the transaction's timestamps that can be set when the
transaction is prepared, using WT_SESSION::prepare_transaction:

| Timestamp | Constraint |Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| prepare_timestamp | > stable and >= any system read timestamp | the transaction's prepare timestamp, see @ref timestamp_prepare for details |

@section timestamp_txn_api_timestamp_transaction Configuring transaction timestamp information with WT_SESSION::timestamp_transaction

The following table lists the transaction's timestamps that can be set at other
points in the transaction's lifetime, using WT_SESSION::timestamp_transaction:

| Timestamp | Constraint | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| commit_timestamp | > stable and >= prepare and >= any system read timestamp | the transaction's commit timestamp, see @ref timestamp_txn_api_commit_timestamp for details |
| durable_timestamp | >= commit | the transaction's durable timestamp, only applicable to prepared transactions, see @ref timestamp_prepare for details |
| prepare_timestamp | > stable and >= any system read timestamp | the transaction's prepare timestamp, see @ref timestamp_prepare for details |
| read_timestamp | >= oldest | the transaction's read timestamp, see @ref timestamp_txn_api_read_timestamp for details |

@section timestamp_txn_api_commit_timestamp Setting the transaction's commit timestamp

The \c commit time is the time at which other transactions with appropriately set
read timestamps will see the transaction's updates.

The commit timestamp can be set at any point in the transaction's lifecycle.
For prepared transactions, however, it can only be set after the transaction
has been successfully prepared.

\warning Commit (and prepare) timestamps must not be set in the past
of any read timestamp
that has ever been used. This rule is enforced by assertions in diagnostic
builds, but if applications violate this rule in non-diagnostic builds, data
consistency can be violated.
Similarly, because reading without a read timestamp reads the latest
values for all keys, one must not commit into the past of such a
transaction.

Applications using timestamps usually specify a timestamp to the
WT_SESSION::commit_transaction method to set the commit time for all updates in
the transaction.

Applications may set different commit timestamps for different updates in a
single transaction by calling WT_SESSION::timestamp_transaction repeatedly to
set a new commit timestamp between updates in the transaction.  Each new commit
timestamp is applied to any subsequent updates. This gives applications the
ability to commit updates that take effect at different times;
that is, it is possible to create chains of updates where each
update appears at a different time to readers.  For transactions that set
multiple commit timestamps, the first commit timestamp set is also required to
be the earliest: the second and subsequent commit timestamps may not be
earlier than the first commit timestamp.  This feature is not compatible with
prepared transactions, which must use only a single commit timestamp.

\warning
It is \b strongly recommended that updates to a single data item always be presented
in timestamp order, although this is not enforced by WiredTiger. Updating a
single data item in other than timestamp order is allowed, and if applications
do this, data consistency can be violated. This is not expected to be supported
in future WiredTiger releases, and applications updating keys in other then
timestamp order are expected to explicitly fail in future releases.
Some diagnostic tools are available to help enforce this constraint;
see @ref timestamp_misc_diagnostic.

For prepared transactions, the commit timestamp must not be before the prepare
timestamp. Otherwise, the commit timestamp must be after the stable timestamp.

@section timestamp_txn_api_read_timestamp Setting the transaction's read timestamp

Setting the transaction's read timestamp causes a transaction to not see any
commits with a newer timestamp. (Updates may still conflict with commits having
a newer timestamp, of course.),

The read timestamp may be set to any time equal to or after the system's
\c oldest timestamp.

This restriction is enforced and applications can rely on an error return to
detect attempts to set the read timestamp older than the \c oldest timestamp.

The read timestamp may only be set once in the lifetime of a transaction.
