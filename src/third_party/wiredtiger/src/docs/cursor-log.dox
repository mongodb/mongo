WiredTiger cursors provide access to data from a variety of sources, and
one of these sources is the records in the transaction log files.  Log
files may not be present in every WiredTiger database, only databases
that have been configured for logging using the \c log configuration for
::wiredtiger_open.  In databases with log files, a log cursor provides
access to the log records.  Although log cursors are read-only,
applications may store records in the log using WT_SESSION::log_printf.

Each physical WiredTiger log record represents one or more operations
in the database.  When a log record represents more than a single
operation in the database, all of the operations in a log record will
be part of the same transaction, however, there is no corresponding
guarantee that all operations in a transaction must appear in the same
log record.

The following examples are taken from the complete example program
@ex_ref{ex_log.c}.

To open a log cursor on the database:

@snippet ex_log.c log cursor open

A log cursor's key is a unique log record identifier, plus a
@m_if{c}
uint32_t
@m_else
int
@m_endif
operation counter within that log record.  When a log record maps
one-to-one to a transaction (in other words, the returned log record has
the only database operation the transaction made), the operation counter
returned for the key will be zero.

The unique log record identifier maps to a WT_LSN data structure, which
has two fields: WT_LSN::id, the log file identifier, and WT_LSN::offset,
the offset of the log record in the log file.

Here is an example of getting the log cursor's key:

@snippet ex_log.c log cursor get_key

The log cursor's value is comprised of six fields:

@m_if{c}
- a \c uint64_t transaction ID (set for commit records only, otherwise 0),
- a \c uint32_t record type
- a \c uint32_t operation type (set for commit records only, otherwise 0)
- a \c uint32_t file id (if applicable, otherwise 0)
@m_else
- a \c long transaction ID (set for commit records only, otherwise 0),
- a \c int record type
- a \c int operation type (set for commit records only, otherwise 0)
- a \c int file id (if applicable, otherwise 0)
@m_endif
- the operation key (commit records only, otherwise empty)
- the operation value

The transaction ID may not be unique across recovery, that is, closing
and reopening the database may result in transaction IDs smaller than
previously seen transaction IDs.

The record and operation types are taken from @ref_single log_types;
typically, the only record or operation type applications are concerned with
is ::WT_LOGREC_MESSAGE, which is a log record generated by the application.

The file ID may not be unique across recovery, that is, closing and
reopening the database may result in file IDs changing.  Additionally,
there is currently no way to map file IDs to file names or higher-level
objects.

Here is an example of getting the log cursor's value:

@snippet ex_log.c log cursor get_value

For clarity, imagine a set of three log records:

- the first with a single operation,
- the second with five operations,
- the third with a single operation.

The log cursor's WT_CURSOR::next call will return a total of seven
records.  The first time the log cursor will return a key with a unique
log ID, a unique transaction ID, and an operation counter of 0.  The
next five returns from the log cursor will have a common log ID, a
common transaction ID, and operation counters starting at 1 and ending
at 5.  The final return from the log cursor will again have a unique log
ID, a unique transaction ID, and an operation counter of 0.

Here's a more complete example of walking the file file and displaying
the results:

@snippet ex_log.c log cursor walk

The log cursor's key can be used to search for specific records in the
log (assuming the record still exists and has not been archived), by
setting the key and calling WT_CURSOR::search.  However, it is not
possible to search for a specific operation within a log record, and the
key's operation counter is ignored when the key is set.  The result of
a search for a log record with more than one operation is always the
first operation in the log record.

Here is an example of setting the log cursor's key:

@snippet ex_log.c log cursor set_key

Log cursors are read-only, however applications can insert their own log
records using WT_SESSION::log_printf.  Here is an example of adding an
application record into the database log:

@snippet ex_log.c log cursor printf
