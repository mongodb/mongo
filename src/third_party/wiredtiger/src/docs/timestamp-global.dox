/*! @page timestamp_global_api Managing the global timestamp state

Applications using timestamps need to manage the global timestamp state. These
timestamps are queried using the WT_CONNECTION::query_timestamp method and set
using the WT_CONNECTION::set_timestamp method.

Applications will generally focus on two of these global timestamps: first, the
beginning of the database's read window, called \c oldest_timestamp, and
second, the application time at which data is known to be stable and
will never be rolled back, called \c stable_timestamp.

The oldest timestamp is the oldest time at which a transaction is
allowed to read. The historic values of data modified before this time can no
longer be read by new transactions. Transactions already in progress
are not affected when the \c oldest_timestamp changes.

The stable timestamp is the earliest time at which data is considered stable.
(Data is said to be stable when it is not only durable, but additionally,
transactions committed at or before the stable time cannot be rolled back by
application-level transaction management.) The stable timestamp is saved
along with every checkpoint, and that saved time is the point to which the
database is recovered after a crash. It is also the earliest point to which
the database can be returned via an explicit WT_CONNECTION::rollback_to_stable
call. (See @ref timestamp_misc_rts.)  All transactions must commit after
the current \c stable timestamp.

Applications are responsible for managing these timestamps and periodically
updating them.

Note that updating the stable timestamp does not itself trigger a database
checkpoint or change data durability; updates before the new stable timestamp
become stable (and thus visible after recovery) as part of the next checkpoint.

@section timestamp_global_setting_timestamps Setting global timestamps

The following table lists the global timestamps an application can set using the
WT_CONNECTION::set_timestamp method, including constraints.

| Timestamp | Constraints | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| durable_timestamp | none | temporarily set the system's maximum durable timestamp, bounding the timestamp returned by \c all_durable. |
| oldest_timestamp | <= stable; may not move backward, set to the value as of the last checkpoint during recovery | Inform the system future reads and writes will never be earlier than the specified timestamp. |
| stable_timestamp | may not move backward, set to the stable timestamp during rollback-to-stable and recovery | Inform the system checkpoints should not include commits newer than the specified timestamp. |

@subsection timestamp_global_set_api_durable_timestamp Setting the global "durable_timestamp" timestamp

The global \c durable_timestamp temporarily sets the system's maximum durable
timestamp, bounding the timestamp returned when querying the \c all_durable
timestamp (see below). Note that the "system's maximum durable timestamp" is
the maximum durable timestamp of any committed transaction, and \b not the
timestamp of data changes which have made it to stable storage.

The \c durable_timestamp is advanced to the transaction's durable timestamp (or
the transaction's commit timestamp, if no durable timestamp was set), by any
transaction commit with a durable (commit) timestamp after the current value.

The \c durable_timestamp is set to the stable timestamp whenever the
WT_CONNECTION::rollback_to_stable method is called.

\warning The \c durable timestamp is used by the MongoDB server and is
generally not expected to be useful to other applications.

@subsection timestamp_global_set_api_oldest_timestamp Setting the "oldest_timestamp" timestamp

Setting \c oldest_timestamp indicates future read timestamps will be at least
as recent as the timestamp, allowing WiredTiger to discard history before the
specified point. It is not required that there be no currently active readers
at earlier timestamps: this setting only indicates future application needs.
In other words, as active readers age out of the system, historic data up to
the oldest timestamp may be discarded, but no historic data at or after the
\c oldest timestamp will be discarded. Retaining history can be expensive in
terms of both disk and I/O resources.

During recovery, the \c oldest_timestamp is set to its value as of the checkpoint
to which recovery is done.

Attempting to set the \c oldest_timestamp to a value earlier than its current
value will be silently ignored.

The \c oldest_timestamp must be less than or equal to the \c stable_timestamp.

@subsection timestamp_global_set_api_stable_timestamp Setting the "stable_timestamp" timestamp

The \c stable_timestamp determines the timestamp for subsequent checkpoints. In
other words, updates to an object after the stable timestamp will not be included in a
future checkpoint. Because tables in a timestamp world are generally using
checkpoint durability, the \c stable_timestamp also determines the point to which
recovery will be done after failures.

During recovery, the \c stable_timestamp is set to the value to which recovery is
performed.

It is possible to explicitly roll back to a time after, or equal to, the current
\c stable_timestamp using the WT_CONNECTION::rollback_to_stable method.
(See @ref timestamp_misc_rts.)

The \c stable_timestamp should be updated frequently as it determines the
amount of work required after recovery to bring the system online.

Attempting to set the \c stable_timestamp to a value earlier than its current
value will be silently ignored.

Using the stable timestamp in the checkpoint is not required, and can be
overridden using the <tt>use_timestamp=false</tt> configuration of the
WT_SESSION::checkpoint call. This is not intended for general use, but can
be useful for backup scenarios where rolling back to a stable timestamp
isn't possible and it's useful for a checkpoint to contain the most recent
possible data.

@section timestamp_global_querying_timestamps Querying global timestamps

The following table lists the global timestamps an application can query using
the WT_CONNECTION::query_timestamp method, including constraints. In all cases,
a timestamp of 0 is returned if the timestamp is not available or has not been
set, for example, the \c last_checkpoint timestamp if no checkpoints have run,
or \c oldest_reader if there are no active transactions.

| Timestamp | Constraints | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| all_durable | None | The largest timestamp such that all timestamps up to that value have been made durable, bounded by the \c durable timestamp. |
| last_checkpoint | <= stable | The stable timestamp at which the last checkpoint ran. |
| oldest_reader | None | The timestamp of the oldest currently active read transaction. |
| oldest_timestamp | <= stable | The current application-set \c oldest_timestamp value. |
| pinned | <= oldest | The minimum of the \c oldest_timestamp and the oldest active reader. |
| recovery | <= stable | The stable timestamp used in the most recent checkpoint prior to the last shutdown. |
| stable_timestamp | None | The current application-set \c stable_timestamp value. |

@subsection timestamp_global_query_api_all_durable Reading the "all_durable" timestamp

The \c all_durable timestamp is the minimum of the global \c durable_timestamp
value and a durable timestamp before any unresolved transaction in the system.

For example:
- If a transaction commits with a durable timestamp of 50 and there are no
running transactions in the system, \c all_durable will return 50.
- If a transaction commits with a durable timestamp of 50, and there is
an unresolved transaction with a durable timestamp of 40, \c all_durable will
return 39.
- If a transaction commits with a durable timestamp of 50 and there
are no running transactions in the system and the application sets
\c durable_timestamp to 30, \c all_durable will return 30.
- If a transaction commits with a durable timestamp of 50, and there is an
unresolved transaction with a durable timestamp of 20 and the application sets
\c durable_timestamp to 30, \c all_durable will return 19.
- If the application sets \c durable_timestamp to 30, and a transaction then
commits with a durable timestamp of 50, \c all_durable will return 50.

\warning It is possible for the \c all_durable value read by the application
to be obsolete by the time the application receives it and applications using
this value to make operational decisions are responsible for coordinating their
own actions (for example by using high-level locks) to ensure its validity.
Specifically, any transaction commit with a durable timestamp (or a commit
timestamp if no durable timestamp was set), larger than the current
\c durable_timestamp value will set the \c durable_timestamp to the transaction's
durable (commit) timestamp. Calling the WT_CONNECTION::rollback_to_stable
method will reset the \c durable_timestamp to the stable timestamp.

\warning Reading the \c all_durable timestamp does not prevent additional
prepared but uncommitted transactions from appearing if a transaction prepares,
setting an earlier durable timestamp.

\warning The \c all_durable query is used by the MongoDB server and is
generally not expected to be useful to other applications.

The \c all_durable timestamp is read-only.

@subsection timestamp_global_query_api_last_checkpoint Reading the "last_checkpoint" timestamp

The \c last_checkpoint timestamp is the stable timestamp of the previous
checkpoint (or 0 if no checkpoints have run).  This timestamp is a general case
of the \c recovery timestamp. Generally, applications are expected to use the
\c recovery timestamp and not the \c last_checkpoint timestamp.

The \c last_checkpoint timestamp is read-only.

@subsection timestamp_global_query_api_oldest_reader Reading the "oldest_reader" timestamp

The \c oldest_reader timestamp is the oldest transaction read timestamp active,
including the read timestamp of any running checkpoint.

The \c oldest_reader timestamp is read-only.

@subsection timestamp_global_query_api_oldest_timestamp Reading the "oldest_timestamp" timestamp

The \c oldest_timestamp is the current \c oldest_timestamp as set by the
application.

@subsection timestamp_global_query_api_pinned Reading the "pinned" timestamp

The \c pinned timestamp is the minimum of \c oldest_timestamp and the oldest active
reader, including any running checkpoint. It is not the same as \c oldest_timestamp
because the oldest timestamp can be advanced past currently active readers, leaving
a reader as the earliest timestamp in the system. Applications can use the \c pinned
timestamp to understand the earliest data required by any reader in the system.

The \c pinned timestamp is read-only.

@subsection timestamp_global_query_api_recovery Reading the "recovery" timestamp

The \c recovery timestamp is the stable timestamp to which recovery was
performed on startup. Applications can use the \c recovery timestamp to
retrieve the value the stable timestamp had at system startup.

The \c recovery timestamp is read-only.

@subsection timestamp_global_query_api_stable_timestamp Reading the "stable_timestamp" timestamp

The \c stable_timestamp is the current \c stable_timestamp as set by the
application.
