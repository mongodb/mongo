/*! @page timestamp_global_api Managing the global timestamp state

Applications using timestamps need to manage the global timestamp state. These
timestamps are queried using the WT_CONNECTION::query_timestamp method and set
using the WT_CONNECTION::set_timestamp method.

Applications will generally focus on two of these global timestamps: first, the
beginning of the database's read window, called \c oldest_timestamp, and
second, the application time at which data is known to be stable and
will never be rolled back, called \c stable_timestamp.

The oldest timestamp is the oldest time at which a transaction is
allowed to read. The historic values of data modified before this time can no
longer be read by new transactions. (Transactions already in progress
are not affected when the \c oldest_timestamp changes.)

The stable timestamp is the earliest time at which data is considered
fully stable. It is saved along with every checkpoint, and that saved
time is the point to which the database is recovered after a crash.
It is also the earliest point to which the database can be returned via an
explicit WT_CONNECTION::rollback_to_stable call.
(See @ref timestamp_misc_rts.)
All transactions must commit after the current \c stable timestamp.

Applications are responsible for managing these timestamps and
periodically updating them.
Applications must move both timestamps forward relative to
the amount of data being written; not updating them can result in pinning
large amounts of data in the cache, which can in turn affect
application performance.

Note that updating the stable timestamp does not itself trigger a database
checkpoint or change data durability; updates before the new stable timestamp
become stable (and thus visible after recovery) as part of the next checkpoint.

@section timestamp_global_setting_timestamps Setting global timestamps

The following table lists the global timestamps an application can set using the
WT_CONNECTION::set_timestamp method, including constraints.

| Timestamp | Constraints | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| durable_timestamp | <= oldest | Reset the maximum durable timestamp. |
| oldest_timestamp | <= stable; may not move backward | Inform the system future reads and writes will never be earlier than the specified timestamp. |
| stable_timestamp | may not move backward | Inform the system checkpoints should not include commits newer than the specified timestamp. |

@subsection timestamp_global_set_api_durable_timestamp Setting the global "durable_timestamp" timestamp

The global \c durable_timestamp functions as application input into the
timestamp returned by querying the \c all_durable timestamp (see below).
It is not otherwise used; in particular, moving it forward does not force
data to disk.
To force data to disk, advance the stable timestamp as desired and
take a checkpoint.

\warning The \c durable_timestamp is not changed when the application calls the
WT_CONNECTION::rollback_to_stable method, and should be reset by the application
in that case.

@subsection timestamp_global_set_api_oldest_timestamp Setting the "oldest_timestamp" timestamp

Setting \c oldest_timestamp indicates future read timestamps will be at
least as recent as the timestamp, allowing WiredTiger to discard history before
the specified point. It is not required there be no currently active readers at
earlier timestamps: this setting only indicates future application needs.
In other words, as active readers age out of the system, historic data up to the
oldest timestamp will be discarded, but no historic data at or after the \c
oldest timestamp will be discarded.  It is critical the
application update the oldest timestamp
frequently as retaining history can be expensive in terms of both cache and
I/O resources.

Attempting to set the \c oldest_timestamp to a value earlier than its current
value will be silently ignored.

The \c oldest_timestamp must be less than or equal to the \c stable_timestamp.

@subsection timestamp_global_set_api_stable_timestamp Setting the "stable_timestamp" timestamp

The \c stable_timestamp determines the timestamp for subsequent checkpoints. In
other words, updates to an object after the stable timestamp will not be included in a
future checkpoint. Because tables in a timestamp world are generally using
checkpoint durability, the \c stable_timestamp also determines to point to which
recovery will be done after failures.

The use of the \c stable_timestamp for checkpoints can be overridden in the call
to WT_SESSION::checkpoint.

<!-- XXX
OVERRIDING THE STABLE ts IN CHECKPOINT NEEDS MOTIVATION AND DISCUSSION -->

It is possible to explicitly roll back to a time after, or equal to, the current
\c stable_timestamp using the WT_CONNECTION::rollback_to_stable method.
(See @ref timestamp_misc_rts.)

The \c stable_timestamp should be updated frequently as it generally determines
work to be done after recovery to bring the system online, as well as allowing
WiredTiger to write data from the cache, and for that reason will affect overall
performance.

Attempting to set the \c stable_timestamp to a value earlier than its current
value will be silently ignored.

@subsection timestamp_global_forcing Forcing global timestamps

\warning
The WT_CONNECTION::set_timestamp method includes a \c force flag which allows
applications to violate the usual constraints.  For example, this can be used to
move \c stable_timestamp backward.  Violating these constraints can lead to
undefined or incorrect behavior.  For example, while moving \c oldest_timestamp
backward with this mechanism may make some historical data accessible again,
other obsolete historical data may have already been discarded, and no
guarantees of consistency are made.

<!-- XXX
USING THE FORCE FLAG NEEDS MOTIVATION AND DISCUSSION. -->

@section timestamp_global_querying_timestamps Querying global timestamps

The following table lists the global timestamps an application can query using
the WT_CONNECTION::set_timestamp method, including constraints.

| Timestamp | Constraints | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| all_durable | None | The largest timestamp such that all timestamps up to that value have been made durable. |
| last_checkpoint | <= stable | The stable timestamp at which the last checkpoint ran (or 0 if no checkpoints have run). |
| oldest_reader | None | The timestamp of the oldest currently active read transaction. |
| oldest_timestamp | <= stable | The current application-set \c oldest_timestamp value. |
| pinned | <= oldest | The minimum of the \c oldest_timestamp and the read timestamps of all active readers. |
| recovery | <= stable | The stable timestamp used in the most recent checkpoint prior to the last shutdown (or 0 if none available). |
| stable_timestamp | None | The current application-set \c stable_timestamp value. |

In all cases, ::WT_NOTFOUND is returned if there is no matching timestamp.

@subsection timestamp_global_query_api_all_durable Reading the "all_durable" timestamp

<!--
    XXX Given the constraints on transactional durable timestamps, it
    seems like all_durable must always be >= stable, no?

    Also, this could use clarification. My understanding from what's
    here is that it's a scheme for tracking what has committed
    recently, and has no direct relationship to what's checkpointed on
    disk and thus _actually_ durable (that's last_checkpoint)... but I
    am not clear on what one does with it if you need to have your own
    application-level locks in order to read it usefully. A description
    of how to use it would be helpful, but I don't know what to write.
    Also, if there are no running transactions, does it reflect the
    durable timestamps of committed transactions, reset to 0, or
    something else?
-->

The \c all_durable timestamp is the minimum of the global \c durable_timestamp
(as set by the application), and the durable timestamps of all currently running
transactions in the system.

\warning Reading the \c all_durable timestamp does not prevent additional
prepared but uncommitted transactions from appearing. In particular it is
possible for the \c all_durable value read by the application to be obsolete
by the time the application receives it, if a transaction prepares
setting an earlier durable timestamp. Applications using this value
to make operational decisions are responsible for coordinating their own actions
(for example by using high-level locks) to ensure its validity.

The \c all_durable timestamp is read-only.

@subsection timestamp_global_query_api_last_checkpoint Reading the "last_checkpoint" timestamp

The \c last_checkpoint timestamp is the stable timestamp of the previous
checkpoint (or 0 if no checkpoints have run).  This timestamp is a general case
of the \c recovery timestamp. Generally, applications are expected to use the
\c recovery timestamp and not the \c last_checkpoint timestamp.

The \c last_checkpoint timestamp is read-only.

@subsection timestamp_global_query_api_oldest_reader Reading the "oldest_reader" timestamp

The \c oldest_reader timestamp is the oldest transaction read timestamp active,
including the read timestamp of any running checkpoint.

The \c oldest_reader timestamp is read-only.

@subsection timestamp_global_query_api_oldest_timestamp Reading the "oldest_timestamp" timestamp

The \c oldest_timestamp is the current \c oldest_timestamp as set by the
application.

@subsection timestamp_global_query_api_pinned Reading the "pinned" timestamp

The \c pinned timestamp is the minimum of \c oldest_timestamp and the read
timestamps of all active readers, including any running checkpoint. It is not
the same as \c oldest_timestamp
because the oldest timestamp can be advanced past currently active readers,
leaving a reader as the earliest timestamp in the system. Applications
can use the \c pinned timestamp to understand the earliest data required by any
reader in the system.

The \c pinned timestamp is read-only.

@subsection timestamp_global_query_api_recovery Reading the "recovery" timestamp

The \c recovery timestamp is the stable timestamp to which recovery was
performed on startup. Applications can use the \c recovery timestamp to
determine the stable timestamp of the system on startup.

The \c recovery timestamp is read-only.

@subsection timestamp_global_query_api_stable_timestamp Reading the "stable_timestamp" timestamp

The \c stable_timestamp is the current \c stable_timestamp as set by the
application.
