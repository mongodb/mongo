/*! @arch_page arch-python Python API

WiredTiger includes a Python API, which is useful for scripting and
experimentation.

The following simple example show some highlights of the API:

@snippet ex_access.py python simple example

The API is implemented using SWIG.  SWIG imports the \c \<wiredtiger.h\> file,
and from it creates the classes and C support files needed to allow
Python to import the WiredTiger library.

Not every facility that is present in the C API is available in Python.
In particular, setting up custom collators, compressors, encryptors and
file system implementations must all be done within the C framework.
