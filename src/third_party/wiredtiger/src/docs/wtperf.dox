/*! @page wtperf Simulating workloads with wtperf

The WiredTiger distribution includes a tool that can be used to simulate
workloads in WiredTiger, in the directory \c bench/wtperf.

The \c wtperf utility generally has two phases, the populate phase which
creates a database and then populates an object in that database, and a
workload phase, that does some set of operations on the object.

For example, the following configuration uses a single thread to
populate a file object with 500,000 records in a 500MB cache.  The
workload phase consists of 8 threads running for two minutes, all
reading from the file.

@code
conn_config="cache_size=500MB"
table_config="type=file"
icount=500000
run_time=120
populate_threads=1
threads=((count=8,reads=1))
@endcode

In most cases, where the workload is the only interesting phase, the
populate phase can be performed once and the workload phase run
repeatedly (for more information, see the wtperf \c create configuration
variable).

The \c conn_config configuration supports setting any WiredTiger
connection configuration value.  This is commonly used to configure
statistics with regular reports, to obtain more information from the
run:

@code
conn_config="cache_size=20G,statistics=(fast,clear),statistics_log=(wait=600)"
report_interval=5
@endcode

Note quoting must be used when passing values to Wiredtiger
configuration, as opposed to configuring the \c wtperf utility itself.

The \c table_config configuration supports setting any WiredTiger object
creation configuration value, for example, the above test can be
converted to using an LSM store instead of a B+tree store, with
additional LSM configuration, by changing \c conn_config to:

@code
table_config="lsm=(chunk_size=5MB),type=lsm,os_cache_dirty_max=16MB"
@endcode

More complex workloads can be configured by creating more threads doing
inserts and updates as well as reads.  For example, to configure two
inserting threads two threads doing a mixture of inserts, reads and
updates:

@code
threads=((count=2,inserts=1),(count=2,inserts=1,reads=1,updates=1))
@endcode

Example \c wtperf configuration files can be found in the
\c bench/wtperf/runners/ directory.

There are also a number of command line arguments that can be passed
to \c wtperf:
@par \c -C config
Specify configuration strings for the ::wiredtiger_open function.
This argument is additive to the \c conn_config parameter in the
configuration file.
@par \c -h directory
Specify a database home directory.  The default is \c ./WT_TEST.
@par \c -m monitor_directory
Specify a directory for all monitoring related files.
The default is the database home directory.
@par \c -O config_file
Specify the configuration file to run.
@par \c -o config
Specify configuration strings for the \c wtperf program.
This argument will override settings in the configuration file.
@par \c -T config
Specify configuration strings for the WT_SESSION::create function.
This argument is additive to the \c table_config parameter in the
configuration file.

@section monitor Monitoring wtperf

Like all WiredTiger applications, the \c wtperf command can be configured
with statistics logging.

In addition to statistics logging, \c wtperf can monitor performance and
operation latency times.  Monitoring is enabled using the \c sample_interval
configuration.  For example to record information every 10 seconds, set the
following on the command line or add it to the \c wtperf configuration file:

@code
sample_interval=10
@endcode

Enabling monitoring causes \c wtperf to create a file \c monitor in the
database home directory (or another directory as specified using the
\c -m option to \c wtperf).

The following example shows how to run the \c medium-btree.wtperf configuration
with monitoring enabled, and then generate a graph.

@code
# Change into the WiredTiger directory.
cd wiredtiger

# Configure and build WiredTiger if not already built.
./configure && make

# Remove and re-create the run directory.
rm -rf WTPERF_RUN && mkdir WTPERF_RUN

# Run the medium-btree.wtperf workload, sampling performance every 5 seconds.
bench/wtperf/wtperf \
    -h WTPERF_RUN \
    -o sample_interval=5 \
    -O bench/wtperf/runners/medium-btree.wtperf
@endcode
