/*! @page message_handling Message handling

@section event_message_handling Message handling using the WT_EVENT_HANDLER

Specific error and other message handling can be configured by passing an
implementation of WT_EVENT_HANDLER to ::wiredtiger_open or
WT_CONNECTION::open_session.

For example, both informational and error messages might be passed to an
application-specific logging function that added a timestamp and logged
the message to a file, and error messages might additionally be output to
the \c stderr file stream.

Additionally, applications will normally handle \c WT_PANIC as a special
case. WiredTiger will always call the error handler callback with
\c WT_PANIC in the case of a fatal error requiring database restart,
however, WiredTiger cannot guarantee applications will see an application
thread return \c WT_PANIC from a WiredTiger API call. For this reason, a
correctly-written WiredTiger application will likely specify at least an
error handler which will immediately exit or otherwise handle fatal errors.
Note that no further WiredTiger calls are required after an error handler
is called with \c WT_PANIC (and further calls will themselves immediately
fail).

The following is a programmatic example of creating a custom event handler:

@snippet ex_event_handler.c Function event_handler

The following is a programmatic example of configuring the previously defined custom event handler:

@snippet ex_event_handler.c Configure event_handler

@section message_handling_output Output format of the WT_EVENT_HANDLER

The messages generated by the WT_EVENT_HANDLER can either be encoded in a flat string style format
or JSON format.

@subsection message_handling_output_flat_string Flat string format

By default, all the messages going through the WT_EVENT_HANDLER are generated as flat strings. The
example below shows a message following the flat string format:

@code
[1637732238:116292][11175:0x123456789012], test_salvage.test_salvage.test_salvage_api(column-fix), file:test_salvage.a.wt, WT_SESSION.salvage: [WT_VERB_SALVAGE_PROGRESS][INFO]: WT_SESSION.salvage
@endcode

@subsection message_handling_output_json JSON format

When configuring a WiredTiger connection through ::wiredtiger_open or WT_CONNECTION::reconfigure, it
is possible to configure the WT_EVENT_HANDLER interface to produce <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a>
encoded messages via the \c json_output configuration option. The \c json_output option takes a list
message categories, where each category represents a method defined by the WT_EVENT_HANDLER
interface, i.e. 'message' represents the WT_EVENT_HANDLER::handle_message interface. For instance,
to print all \b messages and \b error events in JSON format, the following setting needs to be added
to the connection configuration:

@code
json_output=(message, error)
@endcode

See ::wiredtiger_open for the full list of options that can be assigned to \c json_output. Any event
handler interface that is not specified under the \c json_output setting will default to using the
flat string format.

The JSON output follows a specific schema with the following fields:

<table>
@hrow{Field, Description, Type}
@row{category, Message category defined by \c WT_VERBOSE_CATEGORY, String}
@row{category_id, Value representation of the message category, Integer}
@row{error_code, Value representation of the error, Integer}
@row{error_str, Error message, String}
@row{msg, Message, String}
@row{session_dhandle_name, Session dhandle name, String}
@row{session_err_prefix, Database error prefix defined in the \c WT_CONNECTION_IMPL structure, String}
@row{session_name, Session name, String}
@row{thread, Thread id, String}
@row{ts_sec, Time in seconds since Epoch\, as reported by the system's real time clock, Integer}
@row{ts_usec, Time in microseconds since Epoch\, as reported by the system's real time clock, Integer}
@row{verbose_level, Severity level associated with the message. See @ref verbose_messaging for more
details, String}
@row{verbose_level_id, Value representation of the verbose level, Integer}
</table>

Note: The information present in a message depends on the available data at the time when the
message is generated. In other words, all the fields defined above may not be present in a message
as shown in the example below:

@code
{
    "category":"WT_VERB_SALVAGE_PROGRESS",
    "category_id":31,
    "msg":"WT_SESSION.salvage"
    "session_dhandle_name":"file:test_salvage.a.wt",
    "session_err_prefix":"test_salvage.test_salvage.test_salvage_api(column-fix)",
    "session_name":"WT_SESSION.salvage",
    "thread":"22604:0x123456789012",
    "ts_sec":1637730626,
    "ts_usec":20915,
    "verbose_level":"INFO",
    "verbose_level_id":0,
}
@endcode
