/*! @mainpage Reference Guide

WiredTiger is a production quality, high performance, scalable, NoSQL, Open Source extensible
platform for data management. WiredTiger is developed and maintained by MongoDB, Inc., where
it is the principal database storage engine.

WiredTiger supports row-oriented storage (where all columns of a row are stored together),
column-oriented storage (where columns are stored in groups, allowing for more efficient access
and storage of column subsets) and log-structured merge trees (LSM), for sustained throughput
under random insert workloads.

WiredTiger includes ACID transactions with standard isolation levels and durability at both
checkpoint and commit-level granularity.

WiredTiger can be used as a simple key/value store, but also has a complete schema layer,
including indices and projections.

WiredTiger should be generally portable to any 64-bit system supporting the ANSI C11 and POSIX
1003.1 standards.
