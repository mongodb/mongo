@section arch-timestamp-model Timestamp data model and worldview

[This is all in terrible scattershot order and needs to be redone, but
should probably finish a full draft before reworking it.]

In the timestamped world, the timing and ordering of commits is under
application control.
This requires that the application's time be made explicit, as opposed
to being the same as wall-clock time as the application executes.
Timestamps are points in application time.
We shall refer to wall-clock time as the application executes as
"execution time".
Application time generally correlates with execution time, but there
is not necessarily any close equivalence.
We expect that the application's time generally rolls forward and that
the range of application times that need to be considered at any
point during execution is bounded.
The design is not intended to provide arbitrary time travel; nor does
it allow branching timelines, though there is some ability to rewind.

Thus, at any point during execution there is a window of application
time under consideration, which this page will refer to as the "active
time window".
This window is divided into two parts: the <i>stable</i> portion, in
which the composition of the data is fixed, further write operations
are prohibited, and all updates are fully durable; and the
<i>unstable</i> portion, in which changes to the data are still being
accumulated, write operations are ongoing, and updates may be
committed and even checkpointed but are not yet fully durable.
Reading from the unstable portion of the time window is not
prohibited, but if done incautiously can lead to data inconsistency.

The application controls the active time window by manipulating two
global timestamps: the <i>oldest</i> timestamp and the <i>stable</i>
timestamp.
The <i>oldest</i> timestamp gives the earliest point in application
time where the application can/will start new transactions reading.
Attempting to read before this point is an application error.
The <i>stable</i> timestamp defines the point that divides the stable
part of the time window from the unstable part.
The front/future end of the time window is represented by the latest
timestamp that has been used so far; this is, however. not explicitly
managed or tracked.
The application is free to advance time by whatever jumps it wishes.

Internally, WiredTiger tracks an additional bound, the <i>pinned</i>
timestamp: this is the minimum over the oldest timestamp and the read
timestamps of all running transactions.
This is the "real" lower bound of the active time window, used for all
operations that involve dropping or garbage-collecting data that has
aged out.
This ensures that the application can update the oldest timestamp
without compromising operations already in progress.

Within the active time window, each read or write operation (removes
count as writes) is performed at some given application time.
As always, operations are grouped into transactions, and in keeping
with the principle that transactions are atomic, times are attached to
transactions, both conceptually and in the API.
Each transaction has a <i>read</i> timestamp, which is the application
time used for read operations, and a <i>commit</i> timestamp, which is
the application time used for write operations.
(Prepared transactions also have a <i>prepare</i> timestamp and a
<i>durable</i> timestamp, which are elaborations of the commit
timestamp; see @ref arch-timestamp-prepare.)

Each change to a given database item's value is thus associated with a
timestamp.
Consequently, values themselves are associated with ranges of time.
These are called <i>time windows</i>, not to be confused with the
overall active time window of the database.
The value of a database item <i>starts</i> when it is first written
(in application time) and <i>stops</i> when it is next overwritten or
removed.
For any key present in the database there exists some sequence of
values, each ranging from some start time to some stop time.
This sequence is not necessarily contiguous (we do not treat "deleted"
as a first class value; it is the absence of any other value) but
the ranges are not permitted to overlap.
Stop times are not inclusive; that is, when a value is overwritten its
stop time is the same as the next value's start time, and reads at that
time will yield the new value.

Because the portion of the active time window beyond the stable
timestamp is considered provisional, it is discarded at key points:
as part of recovery during startup, on shutdown, and also at any time
the application wishes by calling WT_CONNECTION::rollback_to_stable.

Reads and writes continue to use the transaction system and in
particular continue to operate using snapshot isolation.
Reads will only see updates committed as of when the read
transaction's snapshot was taken, regardless of the relationship of
their commit timestamps to the read transaction's read timestamps.
If reading beyond the stable timestamp, it is thus possible for one
transaction to commit into another transaction's past, which violates
consistency.
Applications are expected to avoid this: in general all commit
timestamps should be greater than all read timestamps, whether or not
the dividing line is the same as the stable timestamp.

Non-timestamped reads in timestamped tables are permitted and proceed
using ordinary snapshot isolation.
This will always read the latest (in application time) committed
values, and is therefore particularly susceptible to the inconsistency
described in the preceding paragraph.

Non-timestamped writes in timestamped tables are also permitted.
These create new values that begin at the beginning of time, retroactively (in
execution time) replacing the entire prior value sequence once committed.
(Snapshot isolation still applies, however: readers whose snapshots
predate the non-timestamped write will continue to see the prior
database state until they commit or get a new snapshot.)

Applications are expected to write the value sequence in order; that
is, for each key in the database, every write should commit with a
timestamp later than the latest existing timestamp for that key.
This is currently not enforced; because MongoDB sometimes issues out
of order updates, they must for the time being be handled.
<!-- XXX and it would probably be good to document what the resolution
rules/semantics are, except I haven't any idea... -->

@section arch-timestamp-representation Representation of timestamps and time windows

Internally, timestamps are 64-bit unsigned integers, where 0 is
reserved and increasing values correspond to later time.
WiredTiger does not otherwise interpret the values of timestamps and
they need not be real time or any clock time; sequential counters are
perfectly satisfactory.
The symbolic values \c WT_TS_NONE and \c WT_TS_MAX give 0 and the
maximum possible timestamp, respectively.

Timestamps are exchanged with the application as strings, printed in
hex without a leading \c 0x, and not as machine integers.
(This is because they are handled using the configuration parameter
system, which is string-based.)

Time <i>windows</i> are handled in memory using the struct type
\c WT_TIME_WINDOW.
This contains a start time and a stop time.
The type actually has seven members:

- \c start_ts (the start time)
- \c durable_start_ts (also the start time)
- \c start_txn (the transaction ID that committed the start of the value)
- \c stop_ts (the stop time)
- \c durable_stop_ts (also the stop time)
- \c stop_txn (the transaction ID that committed the stop/end of the value)
- \c prepare (the transaction-prepare state of the value)

The prepare state is not properly speaking part of the time window,
but it is also a property of the value and needs to be seen at most of
the same points, and in particular also needs to be stored on disk
along with the time information, so is kept in the time window
structure for convenience.

The distinction between \c start_ts and \c durable_start_ts (and
between \c stop_ts and \c durable_stop_ts) is the same as the
distinction between a transaction's commit timestamp and its durable
timestamp.
See @ref arch-timestamp-prepare.

Start times from at or before the pinned timestamp are all equivalent
to "no start time" and can be represented as \c WT_TS_NONE.
Similarly, transaction IDs from past write generations should not be
retained and are represented as \c WT_TXN_NONE.

A value that is current and has not been overwritten or deleted has no
stop time.
This is represented with \c WT_TS_NONE in \c durable_stop_ts but
\c WT_TS_MAX in \c stop_ts, and \c WT_TS_MAX in \c stop_txn.

The on-disk representation of the time window of the current on-disk
value is an optional part of a value cell.
Time windows that are not present are universal (no start time, no
stop time); the stop times that mean "no stop time" are not stored.
Other stop times are stored as differences from the start time to save
space.
Similarly, durable timestamps are stored as differences from their
corresponding commit timestamps.

The on-disk representation of the time windows of older values are
stored differently because those times are used for lookup purposes.
See @ref arch-hs.

Internal btree pages store aggregated time window information for the pages
or sub-trees they reference. This represents, roughly, the union of the time
intervals of the data items on the page. It is used to check if a particular
timestamp interacts with any on-page items so the page can be skipped over
if not. Aggregates are represented in memory by the \c WT_TIME_AGGREGATE
structure, which contains the following elements:

- \c newest_start_durable_ts (\c WT_TS_NONE if none)
- \c newest_stop_durable_ts (\c WT_TS_NONE if none, excludes any \c WT_TS_MAX)
- \c oldest_start_ts (\c WT_TS_NONE if none)
- \c newest_txn (\c WT_TXN_NONE if none, excludes any \c WT_TS_MAX)
- \c newest_stop_ts (\c WT_TS_MAX if none, including any \c WT_TS_MAX)
- \c newest_stop_txn (\c WT_TXN_MAX if none, including any \c WT_TXN_MAX)
- \c prepare (whether any prepared values are present)
- \c init_merge (flag for how the structure was initialized)

These are self-descriptive, except for \c newest_txn, which is the
maximum over the newest start transaction and newest stop transaction.
The \c init_merge flag records whether the structure was initialized
for aggregating time windows and merging with other time aggregates;
this is used during reconciliation to accumulate the aggregate value
to be stored in the parent.
(Otherwise, it was not, and those operations are prohibited.)

Aggregation proceeds one time window at a time by taking maxima or
minima of the various fields of the aggregate and their corresponding
time window fields.

Note that a time aggregate that has been initialized for aggregation
without having any time windows aggregated into it is not valid:
\c oldest_start_ts starts at \c WT_TS_MAX, which is newer than the
starting \c newest_stop_ts of \c WT_TS_NONE. Consequently, such time
aggregates will fail verification. The proper aggregate for an empty
page can be produced by aggregating in a single empty time window.

The on-disk representation of a time aggregate is packed into an
address cell much as the on-disk representation of a time window is
packed into a value cell.

@section arch-timestamp-handling Handling of timestamps in updates and disk pages

In memory, when using timestamps, update structures are timestamped
with the commit timestamp and durable timestamp.
If a commit timestamp has been set when the update is created, it is
applied immediately; otherwise it is set along with the durable
timestamp at commit time.
Non-prepared transactions are also permitted more than one commit
timestamp; applying the commit timestamp to updates immediately
enables that feature.

In general the commit time of uncommitted updates in the cache may not
be known yet and consequently is not used to detect conflicts.
(A transaction attempting a write generates a conflict when updates
invisible to it appear on the update chain.
This causes the write operation to return ::WT_ROLLBACK.
Visibility is computed by first using the transaction ID
to detect uncommitted changes, and then by checking the read timestamp
of the updater against the update's commit timestamp.)

At reconciliation time the visibility code picks the update that
should appear on the disk page (generally, the latest committed
value; see @ref arch-hs) and converts it to a time window.
The value's commit time provides the start portion of the time window;
if the value is followed by a tombstone, the tombstone provides the
stop time, and if it is not, the stop time is set to "none".
This time window is then packed into the on-disk value cell along with
the value.

When a read needs to examine the on-disk value rather than an update,
the unpack logic unpacks the time window as well as the value and
proceeds accordingly.
Ordinary unpacking (though not the "careful" unpacking used by verify)
checks for obsolete transaction IDs that should not be seen (based on
write generation) and clears them.
This process does not clear old timestamps, however.
Old timestamps are cleared explicitly during reconciliation before
cell packing.

@section arch-timestamp-prepare Prepared transactions

Prepared transactions get two additional timestamps: the
<i>prepare</i> timestamp and the <i>durable</i> timestamp.
The prepare timestamp is the point at which the transaction is
prepared, which can be less than the commit timestamp, and the durable
timestamp is the time at which the transaction becomes stable, which
can be greater than the commit timestamp.
These times are permitted to diverge is so that distributed two-phase
commit can reach consensus, which can be slow, without holding up
advancement of the stable timestamp.
The prepare timestamp must be greater than the stable timestamp as of
when the prepare begins, and the durable timestamp must be greater
than the stable timestamp as of when the transaction
commits.

Reads between the prepare timestamp and commit timestamp of a
transaction that has been prepared but not committed fail with
::WT_PREPARE_CONFLICT.

Reads between the commit timestamp and durable timestamp of a
transaction that has been committed but is not yet stable (that is,
the stable timestamp is at or past the commit timestamp but has not
yet advanced to the durable timestamp) are potentially unsafe.
If a second transaction performs such a read and then commits with an
<i>earlier</i> durable timestamp, and a checkpoint includes the second
transaction's stable timestamp but not the first, that checkpoint then
contains inconsistent data.
Avoiding this inconsistency is, for the time being at least, the
application's responsibility.

See @ref arch-transaction-prepare for further discussion of prepared
transactions.
