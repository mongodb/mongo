/*! @arch_page arch-session Session

@section arch_session_def Definition
After a @ref arch-connection "Connection" has been established between the application and
WiredTiger, the
application can start sending requests to WiredTiger using a session. A session is internally
represented by WT_SESSION and plays an important role since almost all operations are performed
under the context of a session.

A session can only be created through an existing connection with the API
WT_CONNECTION::open_session and it is possible to create multiple sessions through the same
connection. In fact, one connection can have multiple sessions but one session can only be
associated with one connection. The maximum number of sessions is set through the configuration item
\c session_max as part of the configuration string in ::wiredtiger_open.

Sessions created by the calling application are called "user sessions". WiredTiger also performs
some internal operations such as @ref arch-eviction "Eviction" through self-created sessions. These sessions
are called "internal sessions". The usage rules and guidelines for both internal sessions and user
sessions are the same and the only difference between them is their origin of creation.

@section arch_session_ops Operations
The different operations that can be performed on a WiredTiger session are related to cursors,
tables and transactions. You can read the complete description of each possible operation in the
documentation related to WT_SESSION.

@section arch_session_txn Transactions
It is possible to group several operations within a session, in other words, multiple operations can
be treated as a single atomic operation. This can be done using @ref arch-transaction
"Transactions". Furthermore,
a session can hold only one running transaction at any given time and this transaction only belongs
to that session.

@section arch_session_cur Cursors
A session can perform multiple data operations on one or several collections using multiple cursors
(see @ref arch-cursor "Cursor" for more details). All the cursors associated with a session share that
session transaction context. It is also possible to cache those cursors if required through the
configuration string given to WT_CONNECTION::open_session or ::wiredtiger_open. The configuration
item for this purpose is \c cache_cursors.

@section arch_session_dhandles Data Handles
During its lifetime, a session can accumulate a list of data handles (see @ref arch-dhandle "Data Handles").
Indeed, when a session accesses a table for the first time, the data handle of that table is
acquired and cached. Once a session no longer needs to operate on a table, it marks the associated
data handle as idle. This helps the sweep server release data handles that are inactive, see @ref
arch-dhandle for more details.

@section arch_session_closure Closure
A session can be closed using WT_SESSION::close. Closing the connection will also close all opened
sessions. When a session is closed, it releases all the resources associated with it including
rolling back any active transaction and closing the cursors that are still open.

@section arch_session_thread Multithreading
A session is always executed as a single thread, see @ref threads for more details.

@section arch_session_error Error and Sub-level Errors Handling
WT_SESSION::get_last_error can be used to provide more detailed information about the last
session API call. The information includes an error code, a sub-level error code and message
providing contextual information. The intended usage of the sub-level error code is to allow
users to programmatically make decisions on the application level.

Internal to WiredTiger the WT_ERROR_INFO structure lives within the session object and
tracks errors that occur during a session API call. The WT_SESSION::get_last_error will return
back any information recorded within the WT_ERROR_INFO structure. An internal function
set_last_error has been created and utilized throughout the code base to set any errors that may
occur within WiredTiger.

There is an assumption made in the code base that an error returned with a sub-level error code or
message will be not changed. Therefore when multiple errors happen within one session API call,
the first error that returns with a sub-level error code or message will be returned to the user.
In the case that none of the errors have a sub-level error code or message, the last error code is
returned.

@subsection arch_session_error_sessions Sub-level Errors - External & Internal Sessions
When saving an error, the session must have the WT_SESSION_SAVE_ERRORS flag set, or the error will
not be saved. External sessions have this flag set while internal sessions do not. This is because
internal sessions are not part of the session API and users do not have access to them. However, when an
external session opens an internal session, it will inherit the external sessions flags including
the WT_SESSION_SAVE_ERRORS flag. This allows any errors that occur to be saved within the internal
session and propagate back to the external session, when the internal session is closed. This is
required for only schema-type operations.
