/*! @page error_handling Error handling

WiredTiger operations return a value of 0 on success and a non-zero
value on error.  Error codes may be either positive or negative:
positive error codes are standard error codes as described for
POSIX-like systems (for example, \c EINVAL or \c EBUSY), negative error
codes are WiredTiger-specific (for example, \c WT_ROLLBACK).

WiredTiger-specific error codes always appear in the -31,800 to -31,999
range, inclusive.

WiredTiger returns \c EBUSY for operations requiring exclusive access, when
an object is not available for exclusive access. For example, the
WT_SESSION::drop or WT_SESSION::verify methods will fail if the object
has open cursors. Note that internal WiredTiger threads may temporarily
open cursors on objects (for example, threads performing operations like
statistics logging), and operations may temporarily fail and return \c EBUSY
when there are no application cursors open on the object.

The following is a complete list of the WiredTiger-specific return
values:

@if IGNORE_BUILT_BY_API_ERR_BEGIN
@endif

@par <code>WT_ROLLBACK</code>
This error is generated when an operation cannot be completed due to a conflict with concurrent
operations. The operation may be retried; if a transaction is in progress, it should be rolled back
and the operation retried in a new transaction.

@par <code>WT_DUPLICATE_KEY</code>
This error is generated when the application attempts to insert a record with the same key as an
existing record without the 'overwrite' configuration to WT_SESSION::open_cursor.

@par <code>WT_ERROR</code>
This error is returned when an error is not covered by a specific error return.

@par <code>WT_NOTFOUND</code>
This error indicates an operation did not find a value to return. This includes cursor search and
other operations where no record matched the cursor's search key such as WT_CURSOR::update or
WT_CURSOR::remove.

@par <code>WT_PANIC</code>
This error indicates an underlying problem that requires a database restart. The application may
exit immediately, no further WiredTiger calls are required (and further calls will themselves
immediately fail).

@par <code>WT_RUN_RECOVERY</code>
This error is generated when wiredtiger_open is configured to return an error if recovery is
required to use the database.

@par <code>WT_CACHE_FULL</code>
This error is only generated when wiredtiger_open is configured to run in-memory, and an insert or
update operation requires more than the configured cache size to complete, or when an application
thread fails to do eviction within cache_max_wait_ms. The operation may be retried; if a transaction
is in progress, it should be rolled back and the operation retried in a new transaction.

@par <code>WT_PREPARE_CONFLICT</code>
This error is generated when the application attempts to update an already updated record which is
in prepared state. An updated record will be in prepared state, when the transaction that performed
the update is in prepared state.

@par <code>WT_TRY_SALVAGE</code>
This error is generated when corruption is detected in an on-disk file. During normal operations,
this may occur in rare circumstances as a result of a system crash. The application may choose to
salvage the file or retry wiredtiger_open with the 'salvage=true' configuration setting.

@if IGNORE_BUILT_BY_API_ERR_END
@endif

standard text message associated with any WiredTiger, ISO C, or POSIX
standard API.
