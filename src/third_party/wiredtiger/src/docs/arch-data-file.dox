@section data_file_database_files Database Files

WiredTiger stores databases in a durable format through writing data to files
it has created in the database directory. These include data files representing
tables in a MongoDB database, a history store file used to track previous
versions of the database tables, as well as other metadata files for the
entire system.

Data files are denoted by the .wt suffix. The history store file
(WiredTigerHS.wt) and the metadata file (WiredTiger.wt) are special WiredTiger
files, but have the same underlying structure as normal data files.

@section data_file_format Data File Format and Layout

In memory, a database table is represented by a B-Tree data structure, which is
made up of nodes that are page structures. The root and internal pages will only
store keys and references to other pages, while leaf pages store keys, values and
sometimes references to overflow pages. When these pages are written onto the
disk, they are written out as units of data called blocks. On the disk, a
WiredTiger data file is just a collection of blocks which logically represent
the pages of the B-Tree.

The layout of a .wt file consists of a file description \c WT_BLOCK_DESC which
always occupies the first block, followed by a set of on-disk pages.
The file description contains metadata about the file such as the WiredTiger
major and minor version, a magic number, and a checksum of the block
contents. This information is used to verify that the file is a legitimate
WiredTiger data file with a compatible WiredTiger version, and that its
contents are not corrupted.

@section data_file_on_disk_page_format On-Disk Page Format and Layout

Pages consist of a header (\c WT_PAGE_HEADER and \c WT_BLOCK_HEADER) followed
by a variable number of cells, which encode keys, values or addresses (see
\c cell.h). The page header \c WT_PAGE_HEADER consists of information such
as the column-store record number, write generation (required for ordering
pages in time), in-memory size, cell count (the number of cells on the page),
data length (the overflow record length), and the page type. This is
immediately followed by the block header \c WT_BLOCK_HEADER which contains
block-manager specific information such as flags and version.

After the page header, pages with variable-length keys or values will have
a set of cells. There are four main types of cells - keys, data, deleted
cells, and off-page references. Cells are also usually followed by some
additional data depending on its type. For example, values may have a time
validity window, and off-page references may have a validity window and an
address cookie. Ordering is important, values are all associated with the
key that precedes them. Multiple values may be present, which can represent
multiple versions. Extremely large values may be represented as a reference
to another page (see overflow pages).

The exact encoding of cells is rather complex, and beyond what can be
described here. The encoding strikes a balance between data that can be
compacted efficiently in time and space, extensibility, and compatibility
with previous versions.

@section data_file_page_types Page Types

Different types of pages are made up of different types of cells.

(1) Internal Pages - as the B-Tree grows in size and layer/s are added,
there will be pages between the root page and leaf page. These internal
pages contain keys that point to other pages.
- The row-store internal page \c WT_PAGE_ROW_INT is made up of a key cell
(\c WT_CELL_KEY or \c WT_CELL_KEY_OVFL) followed by an off-page reference
(\c WT_CELL_ADDR_XXX).
- The column-store internal page \c WT_PAGE_COL_INT simply contains an
off-page reference.

(2) Leaf Pages - leaf pages consist of a page header, followed by keys,
values or addresses (these reference overflow pages).
- The row-store leaf page \c WT_PAGE_ROW_LEAF is made up of a key cell
(\c WT_CELL_KEY or \c WT_CELL_KEY_OVFL) followed by a value
(\c WT_CELL_VALUE/VALUE_COPY/VALUE_OVFL).
- The column-store leaf page (for variable-length data) \c WT_PAGE_COL_VAR
is made up of data cells (\c WT_CELL_VALUE/VALUE_COPY/VALUE_OVFL) or
deleted cells (\c WT_CELL_DEL). The page header has a starting record
number, so the associated keys for all column store values is deduced by
their position in the page.

(3) Overflow Pages - overflow pages are needed when keys/values that are
too large must be stored separately in the file, apart from where the item
is logically placed. Page sizes and configuration values such as leaf_key_max
and leaf_value_max are used to determine overflow items.

While the above gives a general overview of how different page types are
structured, it is a simplified representation. Due to the large amount of
data being stored, WiredTiger may compress data to preserve memory and disk
space. Keys may not be stored in their entirety when prefix compression
is used (the identical key prefix is stored only once per page to reduce
size). In addition, each block written may be compressed and/or encrypted.
The header portion of each block remains uncompressed and unencrypted.

@section data_file_functions Data File Functions

When data needs to be read from a data file, it is unpacked into in-memory
structures, and vice versa, we pack the contents when we want to write a
page image to a data file. Low level functions that pack or unpack the
contents of individual cells are in \c cell_inline.h. Functions
like \c __wt_cell_unpack_kv and \c __wt_cell_unpack_addr to unpack keys,
values and addresses are found here, and uses of such functions appear in
the B-Tree code. Similarly, there are \c __wt_cell_pack_* functions to
pack particular kinds of keys, values and addresses; these are used in
the reconciliation code.
