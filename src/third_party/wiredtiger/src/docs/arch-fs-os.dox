/*! @arch_page arch-fs-os File System Interface and Operating System Support

@section multiple_os Support for Multiple Operating Systems
WiredTiger runs on a variety of systems with different interfaces for file system
and operating system services. Therefore we have abstract implementations of various
OS services, such as threading, clock, etc. We choose which implementation of the
abstraction to include at compile time, and the rest of WT code doesn't need to worry
about these details. Currently WiredTiger supports POSIX and Windows operating systems
through maintaining separate folders for each system. By checking the current machine's
operating system, WiredTiger either compiles the \c os_posix or \c os_win folder.
Additional structures and definitions specific to the operating system are defined
in the header files \c posix.h or \c os_windows.h.

@section file_system_and_handle WiredTiger File System and File Handle Interfaces
WiredTiger provides file system and file handle abstraction layers, or interfaces,
to accommodate for a standard set of functionalities across multiple file systems
that may not have identical features.

@subsection file_system File System Interface
The file system interface handles system calls on the file system namespace such
as creation and deletion. WiredTiger defines the file system interface through
\c WT_FILE_SYSTEM, which is initialized when a WiredTiger connection is opened. The
interface has a set of function pointers that represent the file system functionalities
that WiredTiger supports for a directory. WiredTiger defines POSIX and Windows file
system function implementations in \c os_fs.c.

@subsection file_handle File Handle Interface
WiredTiger has a file handle interface called WT_FILE_HANDLE which defines a
set of function pointers that represent I/O operations for a file. We use this
interface as a base class to create file handle implementations specific to the
operating system, for example \c WT_FILE_HANDLE_POSIX or \c WT_FILE_HANDLE_WINDOWS.
These WiredTiger file handle structures are initialized when WT_FILE_SYSTEM::fs_open_file
is called.

In WiredTiger, whenever a file is opened a file handle is created to accommodate
the state of the file in cache. To prevent multiple file handles being created for a
file, WiredTiger uses a hash table to maintain an single file handle for each opened
file. A structure called \c WT_FH is used for accessing each entry in the hash table.
Thus WiredTiger checks the hash table via \c WT_FH for an open file handle.

@subsection file_customization File System and Handle Customization
WiredTiger provides an API that allows programs to register their own customized file
system using the WT_CONNECTION::set_file_system function. Programs need to supply
their own file system structure and file handle implementations. See @ref custom_file_systems
for an example of how file system and handles are customized.

@subsection file_in_memory In-memory support
The in-memory configuration changes WiredTiger to run only in cache with no disk writes
and is enabled through the WiredTiger connection configuration string. WiredTiger maintains
each file through providing an in memory buffer for each file handle. Both in-memory file
system and file handle implementations are found in \c os_fs_inmemory.c.

@subsection file_stream File Stream
WiredTiger contains a file stream implementation called \c WT_FSTREAM. This structure
is mainly used for non-critical functionalities such as writing verbose messages or
writing to WiredTiger statistics logs.

@section filesystem_usage Multiple System Architecture Support
WiredTiger supports x86_64, i386, mips, ppc, aarch64, s390x, riscv64 and sparc system
architectures which are found in gcc.h.
