/*! @page durability_log Commit-level durability

The next level of WiredTiger transactional application involves adding
commit-level durability for data modifications. As described in
@ref durability_checkpoint, WiredTiger supports checkpoint durability
by default. Commit-level durability requires additional configuration.

@section commit_durability_enable Enabling commit-level durability

To enable commit-level durability, pass the <tt>log=(enabled)</tt>
configuration string to ::wiredtiger_open. This causes WiredTiger to write
records into the log for each transaction, giving all objects opened in the
database commit-level durability. The operational transactional API does
not otherwise change.

\warning
By default, log records are written to an in-memory buffer before
WT_SESSION::commit_transaction returns, giving the highest performance but
not ensuring immediate durability. The database can be configured to flush
log records to the operating system buffer cache (ensuring durability over
application failure), or to stable storage (ensuring durability over system
failure), but that will impact performance.
See @ref commit_durability_flush_config for more information.

It is possible to enable commit-level durability for some database
objects and not others.
To do this, one must pass \c "log=(enabled)" to ::wiredtiger_open and
then pass \c "log=(enabled=false)" to WT_SESSION::create for the objects
that should continue to use checkpoint durability.
(Doing the converse is not supported, that is,
enabling logging on some tables while leaving the global switch turned
off.)

\warning
Making commits to both checkpoint-durable and commit-durable objects in the same
transaction requires caution: if the system crashes before another checkpoint is
taken, any such transaction will be torn, only the commit-durable part of it
will remain and the rest will be lost. In most cases this is undesirable,
however, this combination can be usefully leveraged to create application-level
write-ahead logs and is therefore explicitly supported.

While this is rarely useful, object logging can be toggled during application restart
(in other words, logging can be enabled for a table previously created or used
with logging disabled, and vice-versa). Log records found during recovery are
applied to the table, regardless of whether logging is currently configured for
the table.

@section commit_durability_logs Commit-level durability and logs

Commit-level durability is implemented using a write-ahead log.
When logging is enabled for an object, WiredTiger writes a record to
the log for each update operating on the object.
Transactions group updates, and in keeping with the principle of
atomicity each transaction's updates become durable when the
transaction is committed.

By default, log records are buffered in memory and not flushed to disk
immediately, even when committed; groups of transactions are flushed
together.
(See @ref commit_durability_group_commit.)
It is possible to flush transactions to disk more aggressively if
desired.
See @ref commit_durability_flush_config.

@section commit_durability_recovery Recovery

When the transactional log is enabled, calling ::wiredtiger_open
automatically performs a recovery step when opening the database.
This rolls the log forward; that is, it
reapplies whatever changes from the log are required to bring the database
up to date with the most recent transactional state.

This recovery step
may require extensions be available when it runs (for example, collators
and compression).
Therefore, applications using commit-level durability must configure
extensions with the \c extensions keyword to ::wiredtiger_open consistently
whenever re-opening the database.

@section commit_durability_checkpoint Checkpoints

When using commit-level durability one should still perform
checkpoints of the database.
Database checkpoints are necessary for two reasons: First, log files can
only be removed after a checkpoint completes, and so the frequency of
checkpoints determines the disk space required by log files.  Second,
checkpoints bound the time required for recovery to complete after
application or system failure by limiting the log records that need to
be processed.

Checkpoints can be done either explicitly by the application or periodically
based on elapsed time or data size with the \c checkpoint configuration to
::wiredtiger_open. The period between checkpoint completion and the start of
a subsequent checkpoint can be set in seconds via \c wait, as the number of
bytes written to the log since the last checkpoint via \c log_size, or both.
If both are set then the checkpoint occurs as soon as either threshold has
occurred and both are reset once the checkpoint is complete.  If using
\c log_size to scheduled automatic checkpoints, we recommend the size selected
be a multiple of the physical size of the underlying log file to more easily
support automatic log file removal.

@section commit_durability_backup Backups

Backups are done using backup cursors (see @ref backup for more information).

With logging enabled, partial backups (backups where not all of the database
objects are copied) may result in error messages during recovery, because data
files referenced in the logs might not be found.  Applications should either
copy all objects and log files if commit-level durability of the copied database
is required, or alternatively, copy only selected objects when backing up and
not copy log files at all, then fall back to checkpoint durability when
activating the backup.

@section commit_durability_archiving Log file archival and removal

WiredTiger log files are named "WiredTigerLog.[number]" where "[number]"
is a 10-digit value, for example <tt>WiredTigerLog.0000000001</tt>.
The log file with the largest number in its name is the most recent log
file written. The log file size can be set using the \c log configuration
to ::wiredtiger_open.

By default, WiredTiger automatically removes log files no longer required for
recovery. Applications wanting to archive log files instead (for example, to
support catastrophic recovery), must disable log file removal using the
::wiredtiger_open \c "log=(remove=false)" configuration.

Log files may be removed or archived after a checkpoint has completed,
as long as there is no backup in progress.  When performing @ref
backup_incremental, WT_SESSION::truncate can be used to remove log files
after completing each incremental backup.

Immediately after the checkpoint has completed, only the most recent log file
is needed for recovery, and all other log files can be removed or archived.
Note that there must always be at least one log file for the database.

@section commit_log_cursors Log cursors

Applications can independently read and write WiredTiger log files for their own
purposes (for example, inserting debugging records), using the standard
WiredTiger cursor interfaces. See @ref cursor_log for more information.

Open log cursors prevent WiredTiger from automatically removing log files.
Therefore, we recommend proactively closing log cursors when done with them.
Applications manually removing log files should take care that no log cursors
are opened in the log when removing files or errors may occur when trying to
read a log record in a file that was removed.
