/*! @arch_page arch-btree B-Trees

WiredTiger represents database tables using a B-Tree data structure (\c WT_BTREE in
\c btree.h), which is made up of nodes that are page structures. The root and internal
pages only store keys and references to other pages, while leaf pages store keys and
values. Pages are populated with records as users insert data into the database. Records
are maintained in sorted order according to their key, and pages will split once their
configured limit is reached, causing the B-Tree to expand. Pages have an in-memory
representation as well as an on-disk representation. The focus here will be on
the in-memory representation of the B-Tree and its pages as defined in \c btmem.h. The
on-disk representation is discussed in the @ref arch-data-file page.

@section btree_btree_data_source B-Tree Data Source (WT_BTREE)

As discussed in the @ref arch-dhandle page, data handles (dhandles), are generic
containers used to access various types of data sources. Dhandles that represent
B-Trees contain a pointer to the \c WT_BTREE. At a high-level, the \c WT_BTREE
contains a memory cache of key value pairs, along with functions to read and
write data as needed to and from the data file. It also contains the specific WT_BTREE
type, a reference to the root page on disk for access to the underlying data, and
information used to maintain the B-Tree structure. The different B-Tree types support
different access methods; row-store is most commonly used (\c WT_BTREE_ROW), and
column-store is available with either fixed-length records (\c WT_BTREE_COL_FIX) or
variable-length records (\c WT_BTREE_COL_VAR) (see @ref arch-row-column for more details).

@section btree_btree_in_memory_representation B-Tree In-Memory Representation

B-Trees can grow to a very large size, and the space in memory is
generally not large enough to hold all the pages of the B-Tree. To access a page in
the B-Tree, we require a \c WT_REF which tracks whether the page has or has not been
loaded from storage. Once the page is loaded, the \c WT_REF or reference structure will
have a valid \c WT_PAGE pointer which represents the in-memory page. The \c WT_BTREE
structure contains a \c WT_REF that points to the root page of the given tree. Other
pages can be accessed as required by traversing through the child structures of the root
page, and the child structures of those pages, and so on.

To insert or modify values in a row-store B-Tree, the code traverses down to the leaf
pages which contain the key/value pairs (\c WT_ROW structure). New key/value pairs are
inserted into row-store leaf pages using a \c WT_INSERT structure. Existing entries on
leaf pages can be updated, modified or deleted through \c WT_UPDATE structures. As new
updates are made, these structures are chained into an update list. This means that an
entry may have some old values, or deleted values, which may be visible depending on
the timestamp used by a reader.

@section btree_truncate_operation Truncate Operation

Truncate allows multiple records in a specified range to be deleted in a single operation.
It is much faster and more efficient than deleting each record individually. Fast-truncate
is an optimization that WiredTiger makes internally; whole pages are marked as deleted
without having to first instantiate the page in memory or inspect records individually. In
situations where this is not possible, a slower truncate will walk keys individually, putting
a tombstone onto each one to mark deletion. Truncation is also possible for log files but
the focus here will be on truncation for B-Tree data files (\c file: uri).

@section btree_range_truncate_file Range Truncate On Files

<!-- Caution: the long ref to the arch-fast-truncate page must stay on one line. -->

To perform a truncate on a file, a start and stop cursor are positioned corresponding
to the desired range provided by the user. The desired start and stop keys do not actually
need to exist since the cursors are positioned by doing a search-near rather than a search.
Once positioned, we do a page-by-page walk on the B-Tree, fast-truncating pages where
possible.
See @ref ft_truncate for a detailed description, and see
@ref arch-fast-truncate "the separate page on fast-truncate and deleted pages"
for further description of other ways deleted pages appear and what happens to them after
they are deleted.

@section btree_truncate_interaction_with_other_operations Interaction With Other Operations

Historically we have stated that truncation is not transactional: if a range truncate is in
progress and another transaction happens to insert a key into the same range, the behavior is
not well defined.
This is a hedge for a pair of known bugs, both limited to logged trees.
One is that if the truncation passes \c NULL instead of a cursor for the start and/or end
point and that point changes concurrently, it is possible for log replay to find and use a
different position for the start or end of the tree than occurred in the original
transaction.

The other is a bit more complicated. However, to understand its
behavior one must recognize that truncate is a read-write operation: it scans the tree from the
start key to the end key and deletes every value it finds. Concurrent updates where the same
scan and update done manually would report a conflict cause truncate to report a conflict.
Concurrent updates that this scan would miss (for example, insertion of new rows in a
row-store tree) will be skipped over by the truncate and not cause a conflict. (This is a
form of <i>phantom</i> behavior and is a result of the isolation model, not a transaction
bug.)
The second logging bug is that these phantom writes, which should be left alone, are removed by log
recovery if the transaction that created them commits before the truncate.
The logging for truncate saves the endpoints of the truncate range, not the individual
data items removed, and consequently when replayed with additional items visible it
removes them as well.

Note that pages where conflicts (including prepare conflicts) are possible are always
slow-truncated, and the slow truncate path uses the same update logic as all other updates;
apart from possible logging issues it would be difficult for truncate to be
non-transactional.

For the time being, the hedge remains in the user documentation and no guarantees
are made to users.
