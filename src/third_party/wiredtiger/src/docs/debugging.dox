/*! @page debugging Debugging

WiredTiger contains many assertions and diagnostic code blocks that are used to detect
unexpected control flow and invalid program states. For performance reasons most checks
are disabled by default and must be enabled either by compiling WiredTiger in diagnostic
mode via the \c `-DHAVE_DIAGNOSTIC=1` flag, or for a subset of checks by turning them on at
runtime with the \c WT_CONNECTION configuration item \c extra_diagnostics .
Note that in diagnostic mode all checks are always enabled and cannot be disabled.

There are two types of checks available. Assertions and diagnostic code blocks:

@section assertions Assertions
WiredTiger offers the following assertions:

<table>
@hrow{Assertion, Behavior in diagnostic mode, Behavior in release mode}
@row{\c WT_ASSERT, Always run and abort WiredTiger on failure, Never run.}
@row{\c WT_ASSERT_ALWAYS, Always run and abort WiredTiger on failure,
    Always run and abort WiredTiger on failure.}
@row{\c WT_ASSERT_OPTIONAL, Always run and abort WiredTiger on failure,
    Takes a \c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_* category argument and only runs when the category is
    enabled on the \c WT_CONNECTION. On failure abort WiredTiger}
@row{\c WT_ERR_ASSERT, Always run and abort WiredTiger on failure,
    Always run and take a \c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_* category argument. When the category is
    enabled on the \c WT_CONNECTION and the assertion fails abort WiredTiger. When
    the assertion fails and the category is not enabled on the \c WT_CONNECTION return
    a WT_ERR }
@row{\c WT_RET_ASSERT, Always run and abort WiredTiger on failure,
    Always run and take a \c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_* category argument. When the category is
    enabled on the \c WT_CONNECTION and the assertion fails abort WiredTiger. When
    the assertion fails and the category is not enabled on the \c WT_CONNECTION return
    a WT_RET }
@row{\c WT_RET_PANIC_ASSERT, Always run and abort WiredTiger on failure,
    Always run and take a \c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_* category argument. When the category is
    enabled on the \c WT_CONNECTION and the assertion fails abort WiredTiger. When
    the assertion fails and the category is not enabled on the \c WT_CONNECTION return
    a WT_RET_PANIC }
</table>

@section diagnostic_code_blocks Diagnostic Code Blocks

Longer, more extensive checks are marked by \c `#ifdef HAVE_DIAGNOSTIC` or
\c EXTRA_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED blocks. Similar to assertions these checks are enabled either
by running WiredTiger in diagnostic mode or by setting \c extra_diagnostics on the \c WT_CONNECTION.

<table>
@hrow{Check, Behavior in diagnostic mode, Behavior in release mode}
@row{\c `#ifdef HAVE_DIAGNOSTIC`, Always run the code block, Never run the code block.}
@row{\c EXTRA_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED, Always run the code block,
    Takes a \c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_* category as an argument and only runs when the category
    is enabled on the \c WT_CONNECTION.}
</table>

@section diagnostic_categories Diagnostic Categories

Diagnostic checks across WiredTiger are grouped into categories that get enabled/disabled together.
The following diagnostic categories (\c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_*) are defined:

<table>
@hrow{Category, Description}
@row{\c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_ALL, Enable all diagnostic categories.}
@row{\c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_CHECKPOINT_VALIDATE, Verify data integrity of checkpoints.}
@row{\c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_CURSOR_CHECK, Verify expected outcome of cursor operation.}
@row{\c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_DISK_VALIDATE, Validate correctness of data written to and read from disk.}
@row{\c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_EVICTION_CHECK, Ensure correct page state when performing eviction. }
@row{\c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_GENERATION_CHECK, Check correctness of generation logic.}
@row{\c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_HS_VALIDATE, Ensure correctness of records in the history store and data fetched from it.}
@row{\c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_KEY_OUT_OF_ORDER, Verify correct ordering of keys in the btree.}
@row{\c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_LOG_VALIDATE, Verify correctness of the Write Ahead Log.}
@row{\c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_PREPARED, Ensure correct behavior of prepared transactions.}
@row{\c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_SLOW_OPERATION, Identify and abort on slow operations in WiredTiger.}
@row{\c WT_DIAGNOSTIC_TXN_VISIBILITY, Verify correct visibility of transactional data.}
</table>

@subsection extra_diagnostics_configuration Configuring runtime diagnostics

Enabling assertions and diagnostic code blocks at runtime is controlled by the \c extra_diagnostics
configuration option when opening (::wiredtiger_open) or re-configuring (WT_CONNECTION::reconfigure)
a wiredtiger connection. The \c extra_diagnostics configuration takes in a list of categories. Any category provided in the list is enabled and any category not provided is disabled.
For example:

@snippet ex_extra_diagnostics.c Configure extra_diagnostics
