/*
 * Compaction is the place where the underlying block manager becomes visible
 * in the higher engine btree and API layers.  As there is currently only one
 * block manager, this code is written with it in mind: other block managers
 * may need changes to support compaction, and a smart block manager might need
 * far less support from the engine.
 *
 * First, the default block manager cannot entirely own compaction because it
 * has no way to find a block after it moves other than a request from the
 * btree layer with the new address.  In other words, if internal page X points
 * to leaf page Y, and page Y moves, the address of page Y has to be updated in
 * page X.  Generally, this is solved by building a translation layer in the
 * block manager so internal pages don't require updates to relocate blocks:
 * however, the translation table must be durable, has its own garbage
 * collection issues and might be slower, all of which have their own problems.
 *
 * Second, the btree layer cannot entirely own compaction because page
 * addresses are opaque, it cannot know where a page is in the file from the
 * address cookie.
 *
 * For these reasons, compaction is a cooperative process between the btree
 * layer and the block manager.  The btree layer walks files, and asks the
 * block manager if rewriting a particular block would reduce the file
 * footprint: if writing the page will help, the page is marked dirty so it
 * will eventually be written.  As pages are written, the original page
 * potentially becomes available for reuse and if enough pages at the end of
 * the file are available for reuse, the file can be truncated, and compaction
 * succeeds.
 *
 * However, writing a page is not by itself sufficient to make a page available
 * for reuse.  The original version of the page is still referenced by at least
 * the most recent checkpoint in the file.  To make a page available for reuse,
 * we have to checkpoint the file so we can discard the checkpoint referencing
 * the original version of the block; once no checkpoint references a block, it
 * becomes available for reuse.
 *
 * Compaction is not necessarily possible in WiredTiger, even in a file with
 * lots of available space.  If a block at the end of the file is referenced by
 * a named checkpoint, there is nothing we can do to compact the file, no
 * matter how many times we rewrite the block, the named checkpoint can't be
 * discarded and so the reference count on the original block will never go to
 * zero. What's worse, because the block manager doesn't reference count
 * blocks, it can't easily know this is the case, and so we'll waste a lot of
 * effort trying to compact files that can't be compacted.
 *
 * Finally, compaction checkpoints are database-wide, otherwise we can corrupt
 * file relationships, for example, an index checkpointed by compaction could
 * be out of sync with the primary after a crash.
 *
 * Now, to the actual process.  First, we checkpoint the database: there are
 * potentially many dirty blocks in the cache, and we want to write them out
 * and then discard previous checkpoints so we have as many blocks as possible
 * on the file's "available for reuse" list when we start compaction. Note that
 * this step is skipped for background compaction to limit the number of
 * generated checkpoints. As this step comes before checking if compaction is
 * possible, background compaction could potentially generate an unnecessary
 * checkpoint every time it processes a file.
 *
 * Then, we compact the high-level object.
 *
 * Compacting the object is done 20% or 10% at a time, that is, we try and move blocks
 * from the last 20% or 10% of the file into the beginning of the file. This incremental step is
 * hard-coded in the block manager.  The reason for this is because we are walking the file in
 * logical order, not block offset order, and we can fail to compact a file if we write the wrong
 * blocks first.
 *
 * For example, imagine a file with 10 blocks in the first 10% of a file, 1,000
 * blocks in the 3rd quartile of the file, and 10 blocks in the last 10% of the
 * file.  If we were to rewrite blocks from more than the last 10% of the file,
 * and found the 1,000 blocks in the 3rd quartile of the file first, we'd copy
 * 10 of them without ever rewriting the blocks from the end of the file which
 * would allow us to compact the file.  So, we compact the last 10% of the
 * file, and if that works, we compact the last 10% of the file again, and so
 * on.  Note the block manager uses a first-fit block selection algorithm
 * during compaction to maximize block movement.
 *
 * After each iteration of compaction, we checkpoint two more times (seriously, twice).
 * The second and third checkpoints are because the block manager checkpoints
 * in two steps: blocks made available for reuse during a checkpoint are put on
 * a special checkpoint-available list and only moved to the real available
 * list after the metadata has been updated with the new checkpoint's
 * information.  (Otherwise it is possible to allocate a rewritten block, crash
 * before the metadata is updated, and see corruption.)  For this reason,
 * blocks allocated to write the checkpoint itself cannot be taken from the
 * blocks made available by the checkpoint.
 *
 * To say it another way, the second checkpoint puts the blocks from the end of
 * the file that were made available by compaction onto the checkpoint-available
 * list, but then potentially writes the checkpoint itself at the end of the
 * file, which would prevent any file truncation.  When the metadata is updated
 * for the second checkpoint, the blocks freed by compaction become available
 * for the third checkpoint, so the third checkpoint's blocks are written
 * towards the beginning of the file, and then the file can be truncated. Since
 * the second checkpoint made the btree clean, mark it as dirty again to ensure
 * the third checkpoint rewrites blocks too. Otherwise, the btree is skipped.
