     * This function solves two problems in reconciliation.

     * The first problem is snapshot readers needing on-page overflow values that have been removed.
     * If the overflow value is required by a reader, it will be copied into the HS file before the
     * backing blocks are removed. However, this gets hard because the snapshot transaction reader
     * might:
     *     - search the update list and not find a useful entry
     *     - read the overflow value's address from the on-page cell
     *     - go to sleep
     *     - checkpoint runs, frees the backing blocks
     *     - another thread allocates and overwrites the blocks
     *     - the reader wakes up and uses the on-page cell to read the blocks
     *
     * Use a read/write lock and the on-page cell to fix the problem: get a write lock when changing
     * the cell type from WT_CELL_VALUE_OVFL to WT_CELL_VALUE_OVFL_RM, get a read lock when reading
     * an overflow item.
     *
     * The read/write lock is per btree (but could be per page or even per overflow item). We don't
     * bother because overflow values are supposed to be rare and contention isn't expected.
     *
     * The second problem is to only remove the underlying blocks once, also solved by checking the
     * flag before doing any work.
     *
     * Queue the on-page cell to be set to WT_CELL_VALUE_OVFL_RM and the underlying overflow value's
     * blocks to be freed when reconciliation completes.
