    /*!!!
     * The "OS scheduler timeslice" refers to the fixed amount of CPU time allocated to a process
     * or thread before the operating system's scheduler may preempt it to allow another process
     * to run.
     *
     * A timeslice typically ranges from a few milliseconds to tens of milliseconds, depending on
     * the operating system and its configuration.
     *
     * When the timeslice for a process expires, the scheduler performs a context switch, switching
     * to another ready-to-run process. A context switch can also occur for other reasons like
     * CPU interrupts before the timeslice expires.
     *
     * When a thread starts execution, it receives a fresh timeslice, increasing the likelihood of
     * running uninterrupted for its duration.
     *
     * Potential ways to reset the timeslice are:
     *
     * - yield()
     *   - What it does:
     *     - yield() explicitly tells the operating system's scheduler that the current thread
     *       is willing to relinquish the CPU before its timeslice has expired.
     *     - The thread is moved from the "running" state to the "ready" state, allowing other
     *       threads of equal or higher priority to execute.
     *     - If no other threads are ready to run, the scheduler may reschedule the same thread,
     *       allowing it to continue with its remaining timeslice.
     *   - Impact on timeslice:
     *     - The remaining portion of the thread's current timeslice is usually preserved.
     *       When the thread is rescheduled, it continues with the leftover time.
     *     - In some schedulers (e.g., Linux's Completely Fair Scheduler), yielding might
     *       slightly adjust the thread's virtual runtime, but it doesn't fully reset or
     *       replenish the timeslice.
     * - sleep()
     *   - What it does:
     *     - sleep makes a thread pause execution for a specified duration and transitions it into
     *       a "waiting state".
     *   - Impact on timeslice:
     *     - The thread's timeslice is typically discarded when it enters the sleep state.
     *       Upon waking up, the thread competes with other threads for CPU time as if it were
     *       newly scheduled, with a fresh timeslice being assigned according to the
     *       scheduling algorithm.
     *
     * This behavior is quite consistent across operating systems like Linux, MacOS, and Windows:
     *
     * - yield() does *not reset* the timeslice; it merely pauses execution voluntarily and
     *   retains the remaining time.
     * - sleep() discards the current timeslice, and the thread starts fresh after waking up.
