# wtperf options file: simulate MongoDB.
# This test is identical to the 500m-btree-50r50u tests, but with live restore enabled (without background threads) to understand the perf impacts of live restore. Any changes to that file should be also be made here.
# We use multiple tables to simulate collections and indexes.
# This test assumes that its correlating populate already completed and exists.
#
# Set cache to half of memory of AWS perf instance.  Enable logging and
# checkpoints.  Collect wiredtiger stats for ftdc.
