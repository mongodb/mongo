# Perf.charts

MongoDB charts are useful in displaying the historical performance data allowing users to detect changes in WT performance at a glance.

We constantly upload the performance statistics in MongoDB Atlas to visualize them in MongoDB Charts.

The WiredTiger performance charts are contained in a Charts Dashboard. **Perf.charts** is a file containing an export of that dashboard. This exported file can be easily imported back into a Charts project.
