# This file is derived from evict-btree-hs.py, see that file for its purpose and
# derivation. This benchmark is designed to stress the cache effects of prepared transactions,
# in particular eviction of data in general and prepared transactions in particular.
# These are the ways that this workload differs from evict-btree-hs.py:
# - Insert operations use a prepare call, and commit with a durable timestamp
#   (see use_prepare_timestamp)
# - Update operations commit with a commit timestamp (see_commit_timestamp).
# - Read transactions use a "read_timestamp" that lags the current time (see read_timestamp_lag).
# - The system-wide "oldest_timestamp" and "stable_timestamp" advance periodically, but lag the
#   current time (see oldest_timestamp_lag and stable_timestamp_lag and timestamp_advance).
# - Sessions and transactions use snapshot isolation.
