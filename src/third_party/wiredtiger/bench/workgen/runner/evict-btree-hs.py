# This benchmark is designed to stress disk access to the history store file.
# This is achieved through:
#   - Long running transactions consisting of read and update operations.
#   - Low cache size (~20%) for a reasonably sized WT table with large documents.
#   - Pareto distribution for operations in long running transactions. This will cause
#     skewed access for a selective set of keys in WT table.
#   - Relatively large number of read operation threads to stress cache.

# Benchmark is based on a wtperf config: wiredtiger/bench/wtperf/runners/evict-btree-scan.wtperf
# There are number of changes made to original configs such as:
#   - Reduced the number of documents inserts during initial warm-up phase.
#   - Increased the sizes of key and value.
#   - Reduced the WT cache size.
#   - Added transaction based operations and repurposed some of the read threads as long-running
#     transcation threads.
