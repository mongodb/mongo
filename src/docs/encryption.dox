@section encryption_overview Overview of Encryption in WiredTiger
@ref encryption_custom "Custom encryption engines" may be used to
extend WiredTiger.  WiredTiger does not currently offer builtin
support for any particular encryption algorithm.
@ref encryption_examples "Example encryption code" is provided
to demonstrate how encryption extensions are created.

\warning The encryption infrastructure included in WiredTiger, when used with a
strong encryption algorithm, is intended to protect data stored in files
(that is, <em>encryption at rest</em>). The table content (keys, values),
the metadata pertaining to data (table, index, column names, and other
configuration information) as well as the database log files are encrypted
on disk.  Decryption occurs when the data is read into memory; thus an
attacker having the ability to directly read system memory will have access
to unencrypted data. Many systems may also page memory to a backing disk
under load. Access to any such \em paging or \em swap devices must be
considered when planning the security of a system.

The encryption extension must be loaded in the ::wiredtiger_open call.
See @subpage_single extensions for details on how extensions are loaded.
Also, encryption is specified using \c encryption= in the configuration
for the ::wiredtiger_open call. This configuration establishes
the encryption algorithm and keys to be used for database log files and a subset
of the WiredTiger metadata files. By default, this same encryption
is also used for all data files. We call this the <em>system</em> encryption.

It is also possible to use different encryption options when individual
data files are first created, using the \c encryption= configuration in
the WT_SESSION::create call.  Such options override the default
(<em>system</em>) encryption that was indicated in the ::wiredtiger_open
call for the individual data file. It is possible to turn encryption off
for individual files, to use a different encryptor, or to specify a
different \c keyid.

Overriding the system encryption for a table does not override
the system encryption for indices on that table, nor does it override
the system encryption for column groups specified on that table.
Encryption for column groups and indices must specified when they
are created, if they are to be different than the system encryption.

It is an error to specify encryption in a WT_SESSION::create call when it
was not specified in the ::wiredtiger_open call. This prevents accidental
exposure of the file's data in log files, which would be written in the
clear in such a scenario.

\warning When using separate keys for individual data files or tables, the
key used for the \em system encryption continues to have fundamental
importance.  The database log, protected by the \em system encryption,
contains a shared stream of changes to all data files. Thus, if the \em
system key is exposed, even when per-file keys are not exposed, an attacker
can read database log files, and hence has access to data in individual
files.

@section encryption_parameters Encryption keyid and secretkey

Two parameters, \c keyid and \c secretkey, may be specified
when configuring encryption for ::wiredtiger_open to allow the possibility
of varying the algorithm according to different keys.

The configuration parameter <code>encryption=(keyid=<em>identifier</em>)</code>
may be used in ::wiredtiger_open or WT_SESSION::create calls. This is intended
to reference a key stored using a Key Management Solution (KMS).
The \c keyid given to ::wiredtiger_open is stored in the clear in
WiredTiger configuration files; it should never contain sensitive
information.  As an example, with a \c keyid of \c "customerABC",
the encryptor would consult the KMS to return a key previously stored
for \c "customerABC". The encryptor will use the returned key when
applying the encryption.  To effectively use the \c keyid, a custom
encryptor must implement the WT_ENCRYPTOR::customize callback.
It is during \c customize that the encryptor has an opportunity to use
the \c keyid to fetch the actual key. The \c customize function is
called on the first use of a \c keyid, and the same \em customized encryptor
will be used with each use of the same \c keyid.

The configuration parameter <code>encryption=(secretkey)</code> is used
only in the ::wiredtiger_open call. The value of the secretkey
is never stored on disk in any form, so it must always be provided
when WiredTiger is reopened (again, with the ::wiredtiger_open call).
The secretkey is available to the encryptor during the
WT_ENCRYPTOR::customize callback, during which the encryptor may
be \em customized to keep the secretkey or a transformation of it
for use during the WT_ENCRYPTOR::encrypt and WT_ENCRYPTOR::decrypt callbacks.

If a \c secretkey is used, it must be provided using the \c -E option
when using the \c wt utility. Specifying \c keyid is not needed with the \c wt
utility, as the \c keyid is stored in the clear on disk by WiredTiger.
Any additional \c keyid values needed to decrypt data files
are stored in WiredTiger metadata using the system encryptor.

@section encryption_custom Custom encryption engines

WiredTiger may be extended by adding custom encryption engines
that we call \em encryptors. Custom encryptors must be coded in the C language.
Once packaged, they can be used in any language.

See @subpage_single extensions for general details on extending WiredTiger,
and see WT_ENCRYPTOR for the encryptor interface.

Custom encryptors are registered by calling WT_CONNECTION::add_encryptor,
this creates an encryptor name that may be referenced using the
<code>encryption=(name=...</code> configuration string in the ::wiredtiger_open
or WT_SESSION::create call.

@section encryption_examples Encryption examples

There are two kinds of example code with overlapping functionality.
A simple, self contained encryption example is in @ex_ref{ex_encrypt.c}.
This example includes a small encryptor that rotates letters in the
alphabet by a fixed amount, based on the value of \c keyid.  This example
also shows how encryption is configured within an application.
The second set of examples are in \c ext/encryptors.  These are
encryptors only (no application level code), showing how encryptors
might be packaged in a loadable shared library.
@ex_ref{nop_encrypt.c} merely copies its input to its output.
@ex_ref{rotn_encrypt.c} is an extended version of the example that
rotates the alphabet.  It adds a twist in that a \c secretkey can
be specified, changing the rotation per letter.  The Python test suite
uses the rotn encryptor to help test the encryption framework.

Please note that these samples are for demonstration use only.
They do not provide any security.
