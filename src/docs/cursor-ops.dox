/*! @page cursor_ops Cursor operations

Common operations in WiredTiger are performed using WT_CURSOR handles.
A cursor includes:

- a position within a data source
- getter/setters for key and value fields
- encoding of fields to store in the data source
- methods to navigate within and iterate through the data

@section cursor_opening Opening a cursor

Cursors are created using the WT_SESSION::open_cursor method.  The
following are examples from the example program @ex_ref{ex_cursor.c}:

@snippet ex_cursor.c open cursor #1
@snippet ex_cursor.c open cursor #2

In addition to traditional data sources, cursors in WiredTiger are used
to access projections and even created data sources such as the run-time
statistics:

@snippet ex_cursor.c open cursor #3

See @ref cursors for more information on available cursor types.

@section cursor_closing Closing a cursor

Cursors remain open until either WT_CURSOR::close is called or the cursor's
session is closed, which may either be in WT_SESSION::close or
WT_CONNECTION::close.

@section cursor_position Positioning a cursor

Cursors may be positioned at the beginning of the data source, the end of
the data source, at an exact key within the data source, and near a key
within the data source.

To invalidate the position of a cursor so that subsequent iterations start
from the beginning or end of the data source, use the WT_CURSOR::reset method:

@snippet ex_cursor.c cursor reset

To move a cursor forward or backward in the data source, use the cursor
WT_CURSOR::next and WT_CURSOR::prev methods:

@snippet ex_cursor.c cursor next
@snippet ex_cursor.c cursor prev

If the WT_CURSOR::next and WT_CURSOR::prev methods are called on cursors
without a position in the data source, they are positioned at the beginning
or end of the data source, respectively.

To position a cursor at a specific location in the data source, use the
WT_CURSOR::search method:

@snippet ex_cursor.c cursor search

To position a cursor at or near a location in the data source, use the
WT_CURSOR::search_near method:

@snippet ex_cursor.c cursor search near

Cursor positions do not survive transactions: cursors that are open during
WT_SESSION::begin_transaction, WT_SESSION::commit_transaction or
WT_SESSION::rollback_transaction will lose their position as if
WT_CURSOR::reset was called.

Cursors can be configured to move to a random position with WT_CURSOR::next
is called, see @subpage cursor_random for details.

@section cursor_writes Inserting and updating

To insert new data, and optionally update existing data, using a cursor,
use the WT_CURSOR::insert method:

@snippet ex_cursor.c cursor insert

By default, when inserting into a row-store, the WT_CURSOR::insert method
returns an error if the key already exists in the store, otherwise it
inserts a new key/value pair.  If the <code>overwrite</code> configuration
string is specified to the WT_SESSION::open_cursor method, any previously
existing key/value pair is updated to the new value rather than returning
an error.

By default, when updating an underlying column-store, the WT_CURSOR::insert
method ignores the application's key value, instead, it allocates an unused
record number in the store and returns that record number in the
application's key.  If the <code>overwrite</code> configuration string is
specified to the WT_SESSION::open_cursor method, the application's key
value will be used to specify the record number being inserted or updated.

To update existing data using a cursor, use the WT_CURSOR::update method:

@snippet ex_cursor.c cursor update

In all cases, calling WT_CURSOR::update where the key does not already
exist in the store will return an error.

To remove existing data using a cursor, use the WT_CURSOR::remove method:

@snippet ex_cursor.c cursor remove

@section cursor_error Cursor position after error

After any cursor handle method failure, the cursor's position is
undetermined.  For cursor operations that expect a key to be set before the
operation begins (including WT_CURSOR::search, WT_CURSOR::insert,
WT_CURSOR::update and WT_CURSOR::remove), the application's key and value
will not be cleared by an error.

Applications that cannot re-position the cursor after failure must
duplicate the cursor by calling WT_SESSION::open_cursor and passing the
cursor as the \c to_dup parameter before calling a cursor method that will
attempt to re-position the cursor.  Cursor duplication is not supported
for the backup, config and statistics cursor types.
