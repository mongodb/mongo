# Ignore all golden test output files, which are machine-generated by the "golden"
# jstests. We would have to be able to run prettier (via bazel) during a jstest
# in order to format the "actual" output of the test so that we can safely diff it
# against the expected output, or accept the new output without needing to reformat.
# However, due to difficulties in running bazel within a jstest on evergreen, we
# will avoid formatting these files for now (see SERVER-93772).
