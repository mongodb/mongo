This 2 bedroom 2 bathroom duplex with hardwood floors, full kitchen and large windows for lots of natural light is sure to leave a good impression. The upper floor has a bedroom with a queen-sized bed and a sofa bed in the living room. The lower floor has a queen sized bed and a single bed and has its own full bathroom. Both floors have direct access to the backyard. Although the neighborhood has lots going on, the apartment is very quiet at night for a very goodnight's sleep. The mattresses are very comfortable as well! The building has a washer and dryer in the basement, so you can wash your laundry easily at your convenience.",
