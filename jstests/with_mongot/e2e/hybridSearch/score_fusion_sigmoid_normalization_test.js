// General Note: For all of these tests, we rely on the $sigmoid operator and its underlying logic.
// These tests will pass even if $sigmoid's underlying logic/formula changes.

// Test Explanation: Add a field to each document called negative_score with the range [-1,-10].

// Each document's negative_score field will undergo sigmoid normalization when the $score stage is
// executed because the normalization for $score is sigmoid. This normalized value, bounded
// between [0,1], will be saved on $meta: score. Then each normalized score metadata value will
// undergo sigmoid normalization again for the $scoreFusion stage.

// The $scoreFusion pipeline sorts the documents in descending order by score (documents with
// the highest computed scores ranked first). Assert that the documents are in the correct order and
// have the correct values by asserting that the negative_score and score field's values match the
// expected values which are computed via taking the sigmoid of the sigmoided input score. Also
// verify that the scores were normalized to the correct range and bounded between [0,1].
