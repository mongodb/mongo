/**
 * Tests that $search queries release locks while waiting for network requests.
 *
 * This assertion is made by starting up a number of threads equal to the number of wiredTiger
 * storage tickets available, having each run a $search query, and letting them all block while
 * waiting for the mongot network response by setting a failpoint causing them to hang at this
 * point. With these threads all blocked waiting, we should still be able to run a concurrent query.
 * This would not be true if the threads do not drop their locks/resources while waiting.
