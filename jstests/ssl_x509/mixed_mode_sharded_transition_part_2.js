/*
 * Tests simultaneous upgrade from noauth/no-ssl to x509/requireTLS on a sharded cluster.
 * The purpose is to verify the connectivity between mongos, config server, and the shards
 *
 * NOTE: This test is similar to mixed_mode_sharded_transition_nossl.js in the sslSpecial
 * test suite. This suite must use ssl so it cannot test modes without ssl.
 *
 * This test is split in 2 parts since it was hitting timeouts in slow variants.
