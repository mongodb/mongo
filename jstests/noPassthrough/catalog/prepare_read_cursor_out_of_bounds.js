/**
 * Reproduces a bug where searching for a key returns an adjacent key in a recently-committed
 * prepared transaction. See SERVER-56839.
 *
 * Create an index with a single key, "a". Insert a new key for "b" in a prepared transaction. This
 * creates a prepared, but uncommitted index entry before the key we want to search for, "c", which
 * doesn't exist. We will query for "c" and the cursor will initially land on "a". This is less than
 * they key were searching for, so the cursor is advanced to the next key, expecting to land on
 * something greater than or equal to "c". Before this happens, the prepared transaction commits,
 * making "b" visible. Ensure that the cursor does not return "b" even though we queried for "c".
 *
