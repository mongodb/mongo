/**
 * Tests that when a QueryFeatureNotAllowed error is hit when pulling results from query stats,
 * we skip asserting, and just ignore the entry, despite being in debug build mode,
 * or the internalQueryStatsErrorsAreCommandFatal is set.
 *
 * Normally, when processing a $queryStats command, if an entry in the query stats store
 * produces an error when retrieving and processing for an output of the stage,
 * it is ignored and logged.
 *
 * However, when running in debug mode, or the 'internalQueryStatsErrorsAreCommandFatal' option
 * is set, the stage will raise an assertion, so that a test failure can be caught and investigated
 * (suggesting an error in $queryStats that should be patched).
 *
 * Furthermore, when running in debug mode, or the 'internalQueryStatsErrorsAreCommandFatal' is set,
 * if the error that is encountered is a QueryFeatureNotAllowed, we should not raise such assertion,
 * because it does not suggest an error in $queryStats that should be investigated.
 * This is because we know this type of error is generated only in the following situation:
 * - The FCV is high enough to run some sort of query feature that needs it.
 * - (implicitly this query shape is logged in the query stats store)
 * - Later, the FCV drops below the required version needed to run the aforementioned query.
 * - $queryStats is then run, and this query shape in the store cannot be properly parsed/processed.
 *
 * In this test we simulate this error case with fail-point
 * 'queryStatsGenerateQueryFeatureNotAllowedError' to not rely on any specific query that needs
 * a specific FCV to run, so that this test can be resilient across major version releases and
 * feature flag removals.
