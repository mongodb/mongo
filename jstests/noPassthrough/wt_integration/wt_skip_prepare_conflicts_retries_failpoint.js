// A non-transactional operation conflicting with a write operation performed inside a
// multistatement transaction can encounter a WT_PREPARE_CONFLICT in the wiredtiger
// layer under several circumstances, such as performing an insert, update, or find
// on a document that is in a prepare statement. The non-transactional operation
// would then be retried after the prepared transaction commits or aborts. However, with the
// "WTSkipPrepareConflictRetries"failpoint enabled, the non-transactional operation would
// instead return with a WT_ROLLBACK error. This would then get bubbled up as a
// WriteConflictException. Enabling the "skipWriteConflictRetries" failpoint then prevents
// the higher layers from retrying the entire operation.
