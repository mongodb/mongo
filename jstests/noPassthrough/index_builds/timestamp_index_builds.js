/**
 * This test exercises a few important properties of timestamping index builds. First, it ensures
 * background index builds on primaries and secondaries timestamp both `init` and `commit`
 * operations on the catalog.
 *
 * Second, this test ensures the entire index build is ahead of the majority point. Thus when
 * restarting as a standalone, those indexes are not observed. When restarted with `--replSet`,
 * the indexes will be rebuilt. Currently performing a background index build at startup before
 * the logical clock is initialized will fail to timestamp index completion. The code currently
 * fixes this by foregrounding those index builds. We can observe the correctness of this behavior
 * by once again restarting the node as a standalone and not seeing any evidence of the second
 * index.
 *
 * This test does not guarantee that background index builds are foregrounded to correct
 * timestamping, merely that the catalog state is not corrupted due to the existence of background
 * index builds.
 *
 * @tags: [
 *   # TODO(SERVER-109702): Evaluate if a primary-driven index build compatible test should be created.
 *   requires_commit_quorum,
 *   requires_majority_read_concern,
 *   requires_persistence,
 *   requires_replication,
