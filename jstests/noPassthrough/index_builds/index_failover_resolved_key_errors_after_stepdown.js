/**
 * Confirms that an index build is committed after step-up by a new primary when there are key
 * generation errors that are eventually resolved. This test orchestrates a scenario such that a
 * primary steps down before scanning a collection with invalid documents, and before receiving an
 * update that resolves the error. After step-up, the new primary will apply the update before
 * committing. The expected result is that the node, now primary, commits the index build for the
 * entire replica set.
