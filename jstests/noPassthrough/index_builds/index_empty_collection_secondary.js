/**
 * Confirms that index creation on a secondary does not use the optimization for empty collections
 * that a primary would apply to two phase index builds.
 *
 * This test starts an index build on a non-empty collection but clears the collection
 * before the index build is added to the catalog. This causes the secondary to see an empty
 * collection.
 *
 * This test should also work when the primary builds the index single-phased. The secondary should
 * be able to optimize for the empty collection case and build the index inlined.
