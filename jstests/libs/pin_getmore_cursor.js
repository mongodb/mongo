 * Creates a cursor, then pins it in a parallel shell by using the provided 'failPointName' and

 * 'conn': a connection to an instance of a mongod or mongos.
 * 'sessionId': The id present if the database is currently in a session.
 * 'dbName': the database to use with the cursor.
 *
 * 'assertFunction(cursorId, coll)':
 *   A function containing the test to be run while the cursor is pinned.
 *
 * 'runGetMoreFunc':
 *   A function to be executed in the parallel shell. It is expected to hit the fail point, defined
