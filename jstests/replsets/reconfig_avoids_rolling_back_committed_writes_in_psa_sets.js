/**
 * Tests the correct workflow for adding a voting electable node in a PSA set and ensures that no
 * committed writes will be rolled back after that workflow. We start with a PSA set. We shut down
 * the secondary and reconfigure it to have votes 0. Then, we do a majority write that will commit
 * only on the primary, so that the secondary is now missing a majority committed write. Next, we
 * test the correct workflow, which involves two reconfigs:
 *
 * 1) Give the secondary votes: 1 but priority: 0. This will not allow the stale secondary to run
 * for election
 *
 * 2) Increase the priority on the secondary. With this reconfig, because of the Oplog
 * Committment rule, the secondary must have the previously committed write, and so it can safely
 * become the primary
 *
 * Finally, we step up the secondary and verify that the oplog entry was not rolled back.
