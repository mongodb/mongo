/**
 * Tests that initial sync properly fetches from the oldest active transaction timestamp, but that
 * it only applies from the beginApplyingTimestamp. The beginApplyingTimestamp is the timestamp of
 * the oplog entry that was last applied on the sync source before initial sync begins. It is also
 * the timestamp after which we will start applying operations during initial sync.
 *
 * To make sure that it is applying from the correct point, the test prepares a transaction before
 * the beginFetchingTimestamp and commits it before the beginApplyingTimestamp. Since the
 * transaction is not active by the time initial sync begins, its prepare oplog entry
 * won't be fetched during oplog application and trying to apply the commitTransaction oplog entry
 * will cause initial sync to fail.
