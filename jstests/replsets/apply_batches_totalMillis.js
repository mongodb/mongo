/**
 * serverStatus.metrics.repl.apply.batches.totalMillis is a cumulative measure of how much time a
 * node spends applying batches. This test checks that it includes the time spent waiting for
 * batches to finish by making sure that the timer is cumulative and monotonic. We cannot make
 * any assumptions about how long batches actually take as that can vary enormously between
 * machines and test runs.
