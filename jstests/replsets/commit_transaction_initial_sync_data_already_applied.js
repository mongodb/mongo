/**
 * Tests that initial sync successfully applies the commitTransaction oplog entry even if the data
 * already reflects the transaction and that initial sync will apply each operation from the
 * transaction in separate storage transactions.
 *
 * We pause initial sync before any collection cloning and run commitTransaction so that the data
 * will reflect the transaction when the commitTransaction oplog entry is applied during the oplog
 * application phase of initial sync. The transaction is set up so that when applied, one of its
 * operations will fail, but a later operation will need to succeed to pass the test. This will show
 * that operations from a transaction are executed in separate storage transactions.
