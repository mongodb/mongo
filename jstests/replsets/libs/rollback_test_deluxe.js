/**
 * Like RollbackTest, but with five nodes (a primary, two secondaries and two arbiters). This allows
 * for a controlled rollback on two nodes: one that performs writes as a primary, and one that
 * performs writes as a secondary.
 *
 * This library exposes the following 5 sequential stages of rollback:
 *
 *   1. RollbackTest starts in kSteadyStateOps: the replica set is in steady state replication.
 *          Operations applied will be replicated.
 *   2. kRollbackOps: operations applied during this phase will not be replicated and eventually be
 *          rolled back on both a primary and a secondary.
 *   3. kSyncSourceOpsBeforeRollback: apply operations on the sync source before rollback begins.
 *   4. kSyncSourceOpsDuringRollback: apply operations on the sync source after rollback has begun.
 *   5. kSteadyStateOps: (same as stage 1) with the option of waiting for the rollback to finish.
 *
 * Refer to the various "transition" functions for more information on the behavior of each stage.
 *
 * With each complete five-step rollback (a "rollback cycle"), one node rolls back writes performed
 * as a primary (the "primary"), one node rolls back writes performed as a secondary (the "rollback
 * secondary"), and one node steps up from secondary to primary (the "standby secondary"). Their
 * roles are then reassigned based on the RoleCycleMode:
 *
 *   - kCyclical:
 *          Each node rotates to a new state. Performing multiple rollback cycles in this mode
 *          allows each node to experience rollbacks in different states. Three complete rollback
 *          cycles returns each node back to its original role.
 *   - kFixedRollbackSecondary:
 *          The primary and standby secondary swap back and forth, taking turns undergoing rollback
 *          as primaries. The rollback secondary stays fixed and undergoes rollback as a secondary
 *          every time.
 *   - kRandom:
 *          Roles are assigned at random.
 *
 * The default role cycle mode is kCyclical, though it is not guaranteed to be respected in the face
 * of restarts.
