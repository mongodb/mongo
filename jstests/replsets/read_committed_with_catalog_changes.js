/**
 * Test read committed functionality when mixed with catalog changes. Since we don't support
 * multiple versions of the catalog, operations that modify the catalog may need to lock out
 * committed readers until the modification is in the committed snapshot.
 *
 * The following replicated operations are tested here:
 *  - creating a collection in an existing db
 *  - creating a collection in a new db
 *  - dropping a collection
 *  - dropping a db
 *  - dropping a collection and creating one with the same name
 *  - dropping a db and creating one with the same name
 *  - renaming a collection to a new, unused name
 *  - renaming a collection on top of an existing collection
 *  - creating a foreground index
 *  - creating a background index
 *  - dropping an index
 *
 * The following non-replicated operations are tested here:
 *  - repair database
 *  - reindex collection
 *  - compact collection
 *

 *   requires_majority_read_concern,
