/**
 * Test that nodes will not prioritize choosing the primary as a sync source over a candidate
 * node that is in a closer data center than the primary. We do this with a four node replica
 * set (P, S, targetS, and test). We create three data centers, and configure delays such that
 * the test node is initially syncing from S, which is in the same datacenter as P, and the
 * targetS is in the data center closest to the test node.
 * Finally, we verify that the test node will decide to sync from targetS, since it is in the
 * closest data center.
