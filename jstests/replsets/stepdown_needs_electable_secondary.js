/**
 * Test to ensure that replSetStepDown called on a primary will only succeed if a majority of nodes
 * are caught up to it and that at least one node in this majority is electable. Tests this with a
 * 5 node replica set.
 *
 * 1.  Initiate a 5-node replica set
 * 2.  Disable replication to all secondaries
 * 3.  Execute some writes on primary
 * 4.  Try to step down primary and expect to fail
 * 5.  Enable replication to one unelectable secondary, secondary B
 * 6.  Await replication to secondary B by executing primary write with writeConcern:2
 * 7.  Try to step down primary and expect failure
 * 8.  Enable replication to a different unelectable secondary, secondary C
 * 9.  Await replication to secondary C by executing primary write with writeConcern:3
 * 10. Try to step down primary and expect failure
 * 11. Enable replication to an electable secondary, secondary A
 * 12. Await replication to secondary A by executing primary write with writeConcern:4
 * 13. Try to step down primary and expect success
 * 14. Assert that original primary is now a secondary
