/**
 * Tests that initial sync successfully reconstructs a prepared transaction even when the sync
 * source started a transaction before the oplog application phase began but after the syncing node
 * fetched the oldest active transaction timestamp.
 *
 * To test this, we pause initial sync after the syncing node has fetched the oldest active
 * transaction timestamp from its sync source. Since there are no in-progress transactions, this
 * value will be null. While paused, the syncing node will start and prepare a transaction and do an
 * additional write. This will mean that when initial sync is unpaused, the syncing node will set
 * the begin applying timestamp to after the prepare timestamp. We can then test that the node still
 * fetches all the oplog entries it needs to reconstruct the prepared transaction.
