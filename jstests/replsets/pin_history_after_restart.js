/**
 * This test uses the test only `pinHistoryReplicated` command to exercise the DurableHistoryPins
 * across restart.
 *
 * The `pinHistoryReplicated` command will pin the oldest timestamp at the requested time (with an
 * optional rounding up to oldest). If the pin is successfully, the pinned time is written to a
 * document inside `mdb_testing.pinned_timestamp`.
 *
 * When the `TestingDurableHistoryPin` is registered at startup, it will repin the oldest timestamp
 * at the minimum of all documents written to `mdb_testing.pinned_timestamp`.
 *
 * This test does the following:
 *
 * 1) Pin the timestamp with an artificially small value to take advantage of rounding.
 * 2) See that the timestamp is pinned via serverStatus.
 * 3) Restart the node, see the pin persist.
 * 4) Make a new pin at "original pin" + 1
 * 5) Remove the pin at "original pin"
 * 6) Restart the node, see the incremented pin value from serverStatus.
 *
