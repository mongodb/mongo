/**
 * Tests that arbiters cannot be used to acknowledge w:number writes even when some of the
 * required secondaries are unavailable. After a write commits, the corresponding
 * lastCommittedOpTime becomes the lastAppliedOpTime on arbiters in the set. This particular test
 * uses a PSSAA set where both of the secondaries are non-voting, which makes the majority only one
 * node. The effect of this configuration is that writes only need to be on the primary to commit.
 * A w:2 write would thus require only one additional member to fully satisfy the write concern
 * after committing. This test therefore shuts down the both secondaries and verifies that neither
 * of the arbiters gets picked in its place and the w:2 write times out instead.
