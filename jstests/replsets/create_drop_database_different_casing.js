/**
 * Ensures that the drop database oplog entry gets sent to the secondaries prior to dropping the
 * in memory state of the database in the primary during the 'dropDatabase' command.
 * Dropping the in memory state of the database before sending the drop database oplog entry to the
 * secondaries first can result in a situation where the secondaries crash during replication.
 * The secondaries would crash given this scenario:
 *     - At time 10: Primary drops database "A"'s in memory state.
 *     - At time 15: Primary creates database "a" and sends the create database oplog entries to the
 *                   secondaries.
 *     - At time 20: Secondaries apply create database oplog entry and crash because database "A"
 *                   still exists in-memory for them.
 *     - At time 25: Primary sends database "A"'s drop oplog entry to secondaries (already crashed).
