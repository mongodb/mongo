/**
 * Tests that initial sync successfully reconstructs a prepared transaction using the oplog seed
 * entry after failing the first attempt of initial sync and that we can commit the transactions
 * afterwards. During the first attempt of initial sync, there will be some oplog entries that need
 * to be applied and the lastApplied OpTime will be advanced along with the oplog application. We
 * test that the lastApplied and the localSnapshot are properly reset after the first attempt fails.
 * During the second attempt of initial sync, there will be no oplog entries that need to be applied
 * and the prepare oplog entry will be inserted as the oplog seed. We then make sure the oplog seed
 * entry is visible and the prepared transaction is properly reconstructed.
