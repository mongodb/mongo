/**
 * Tests that initial sync properly fetches from the oldest active transaction timestamp, even if
 * the beginApplyingTimestamp and the stopTimestamp are the same. The beginApplyingTimestamp is the
 * timestamp of the oplog entry that was last applied on the sync source before initial sync begins.
 * It is also the timestamp after which we will start applying operations during initial sync. The
 * stopTimestamp is the timestamp of the oplog entry that was last applied on the sync source when
 * before the oplog application phase of initial sync begins. If they are the same, it means that
 * no operations were run on the sync source during the collection cloning phase of initial sync and
 * so no oplog entries need to be applied.
 *
 * To make sure that it is applying from the correct point, the test prepares a transaction before
 * the beginFetchingTimestamp and commits it before the beginApplyingTimestamp. Since the
 * transaction is not active by the time initial sync begins, its prepareTransaction oplog entry
 * won't be fetched during oplog application and trying to apply the commitTransaction oplog entry
 * will cause initial sync to fail.
