// on the primary), we're using "applyOps" to artificially create that state.
// Suppose the oplog looks like:
// [
//     {op: i, ts: 1 ..., rid: 3},
//     {op: i, ts: 2 ..., rid: 1},
//     {op: i, ts: 3 ..., rid: 2}

// This is as though before the last two writes got replicated, the
// secondary became the primary.
