/**
 * Test to ensure that initial sync builds indexes correctly when syncing a capped collection that
 * is receiving concurrent inserts.
 *
 * The main goal of this test is to have the SECONDARY clone more documents than would actually fit
 * in a specific capped collection, leading to the deletion of documents (i.e. 'capping') on the
 * SECONDARY *during* the collection cloning process. This scenario is encountered when a SECONDARY
 * opens a cursor on a capped collection, begins iterating on that cursor, and, before the cursor is
 * exhausted, new documents get appended to the capped collection that it is cloning.
 *
 * Test Setup:
 * 1-node replica set that is reconfigured to a 2-node replica set.
 *
 * 1. Initiate replica set.
 * 2. Create a capped collection on the PRIMARY and overflow it.
 * 4. Add a SECONDARY node to the replica set.
 * 5. Set fail point on SECONDARY that hangs capped collection clone after first 'find' response.
 * 6. Let SECONDARY start initial sync.
 * 7. Wait for initial 'find' response during the cloning of the capped collection.
 * 8. Insert documents to the capped collection on the PRIMARY.
 * 9, Disable fail point on SECONDARY so the rest of the capped collection documents are cloned.
 * 8. Once initial sync completes, ensure that capped collection indexes on the SECONDARY are valid.
 *
 * This is a regression test for SERVER-29197.
