/**
 * Tests that nodes that are syncing from a node in a far away data center will eventually choose to
 * sync from a node in a closer data center. We do this with a three node replica set (P, S1, and
 * S2). We create a data center for each node and configure delays such that P's data center is
 * significantly farther away from S2 than S1's data center. Finally, we verify that S2 will decide
 * to sync from S1, since S1's data center is closer.
