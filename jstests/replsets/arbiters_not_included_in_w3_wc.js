/**
 * Tests that arbiters cannot be used to acknowledge w:number writes even when some of the
 * required secondaries are unavailable. After a write commits, the corresponding
 * lastCommittedOpTime becomes the lastAppliedOpTime on arbiters in the set. This particular test
 * uses a PSSA set where one of the secondaries is non-voting, which makes the majority 2 nodes.
 * This means that a write needs to replicate to only one of the secondaries to commit. A w:3
 * write would thus require only one additional member to fully satisfy the write concern after
 * committing. This test therefore shuts down the last secondary and verifies that the arbiter does
 * *not* get picked in its place and the w:3 write times out instead.
