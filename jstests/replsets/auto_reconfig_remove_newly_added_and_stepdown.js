/**
 * "This test is supposed to reproduce an invariant failure where a node that is stepping down due
 * to a new term will hit an invariant during a scheduled automatic reconfig to remove a
 * "newlyAdded" field.
 * 1. Start a 3 node replica set
 * 2. Enable a fail point that hangs during automatic reconfig
 * 3. Add another node (nodes[3]) to the set
 * 4. Wait till the above fail point is reached
 * 5. Enable a fail point that blocks a heartbeat caused stepdown before updating the term
 * 6. Cause a stepdown by disconnecting two secondary nodes from the primary
 * 7. Wait for the node nodes[1] to step up and become primary as the only one having non-0
 * priority)
 * 8. Wait until stepdown fail point from (5) is reached.
 * 9. Release the auto reconfig failpoint to make auto reconfig proceed and reach the new check that
 * verifies there is no pending term update and fail because of it
 * 10. Make sure the failure took place via checking logs.
 * 11. Make sure "newlyAdded" for a nodes[3] field is still being removed by the new primary via log
 * check
 * 12. Release a stepdown fail point
