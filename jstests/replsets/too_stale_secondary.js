/**
 * This test ensures that a secondary that has gone "too stale" (i.e. cannot find another node with
 * a common oplog point) will transition to RECOVERING state, stay in RECOVERING after restart, and
 * transition back to SECONDARY once it finds a sync source with a common oplog point.
 *
 * Note: This test requires persistence in order for a restarted node with a stale oplog to stay in
 * the RECOVERING state. A restarted node with an ephemeral storage engine will not have an oplog
 * upon restart, so will immediately resync.
 *
 * @tags: [
 *   requires_persistence,
 * ]
 *
 * Replica Set Setup:
 *
 * Node 0 (PRIMARY)     : Small Oplog
 * Node 1 (SECONDARY)   : Large Oplog
 * Node 2 (SECONDARY)   : Small Oplog
 *
 * 1:  Insert one document on the primary (Node 0) and ensure it is replicated.
 * 2:  Stop node 2.
 * 3:  Wait until Node 2 is down.
 * 4:  Overflow the primary's oplog.
 * 5:  Stop Node 1 and restart Node 2.
 * 6:  Wait for Node 2 to transition to RECOVERING (it should be too stale).
 * 7:  Stop and restart Node 2.
 * 8:  Wait for Node 2 to transition to RECOVERING (its oplog should remain stale after restart).
 * 9:  Restart Node 1, which should have the full oplog history.
 * 10: Wait for Node 2 to leave RECOVERING and transition to SECONDARY.
