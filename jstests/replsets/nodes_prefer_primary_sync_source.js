/**
 * Test that given primary and secondary eligible sync source candidates with similar ping times,
 * a syncing node will choose to sync from the primary node even if it has a higher ping time.
 * The primary and secondary candidate must be within the same data center for the syncing node
 * to make this choice. We do this with a four node replica set (P, S, farS, and test). We
 * create four data centers, and configure delays such that the test node is initially syncing
 * from the farthest node farS, and P and S have minimal ping difference where S is slightly
 * closer to the test node, but P and S still mimic being in the same data center.
 * Finally, we verify that the test node will decide to sync from P, since it is in a closer
 * data center, and we prefer it over S.
