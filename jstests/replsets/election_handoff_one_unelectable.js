/**
 * This is a basic test that checks that, with election handoff enabled, a primary that steps down
 * sends a ReplSetStepUp request to an eligible candidate. This test uses a three-node replica
 * set, where one of the secondaries is unelectable, so the test expects the other one to get
 * chosen for election handoff.
