/*
 * Basic test of successful replica set rollback for system.views creation.
 *
 * This test sets up a 3 node set, data-bearing nodes A and B and an arbiter.
 *
 * 1. A is elected PRIMARY and inserts into "test1.coll", which is propagated to B.
 * 2. A is isolated from the rest of the set and B is elected PRIMARY.
 * 3. B creates views "test1.x" and "test2.y" (creating test[12].system.views)
 *    and collection "test3.z", which will later be undone during rollback.
 * 4. B is then isolated and A regains its connection to the arbiter.
 * 5. A inserts a document into collection "test1.x", and creates views "test2.y" and "test3.z"
 *     which B will replicate after rollback.
 * 6. B rejoins the set and goes through the rollback/recovery process.
 * 7. The contents of A and B are compared to ensure the rollback results in consistent nodes,
 *    and have the expected collections and views..
