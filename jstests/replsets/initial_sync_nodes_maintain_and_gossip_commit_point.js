/**
 * Tests that nodes in initial sync update their commit point and gossip their commit point to
 * other nodes. This is done starting with a 3 node replica set with one non-voting secondary. We
 * disconnect the non-voting secondary from the other nodes and then add a new node to the replica
 * set. Thus, the non-voting secondary can only communicate with the initial syncing node. We then
 * hang the initial syncing node at various stages, perform multiple majority writes to advance the
 * commit point, and verify that the commit point on the initial syncing node is updated. Finally,
 * we ensure that the disconnected secondary is able to update its commit point from the initial
 * syncing node via heartbeats.
