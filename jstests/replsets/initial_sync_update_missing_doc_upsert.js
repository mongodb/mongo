/**
 * Initial sync runs in several phases - the first 3 are as follows:
 * 1) fetches the last oplog entry (op_start1) on the source;
 * 2) copies all non-local databases from the source; and
 * 3) fetches and applies operations from the source after op_start1.
 *
 * This test upserts documents with both the "update" and "applyOps" commands on the source between
 * phases 2 and 3; these operations should be treated as inserts on the syncing node and applied
 * successfully.
