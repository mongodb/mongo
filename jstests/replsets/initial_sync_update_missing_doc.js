/**
 * Initial sync runs in several phases - the first 3 are as follows:
 * 1) fetches the last oplog entry (op_start1) on the source;
 * 2) copies all non-local databases from the source; and
 * 3) fetches and applies operations from the source after op_start1.
 *
 * This test updates and deletes a document on the source between phases 1 and 2. The secondary will
 * fail to apply the update operation in phase 3 but initial sync completes nevertheless. The
 * absence of the document on the source indicates that the source is free to ignore the failed
 * update operation.
