 * This test involves three nodes and runs as follows:

 *  - Node B finishes initial sync and the transaction is still prepared.
 *  - Node C is restarted and starts initial syncing from Node B.
 *  - Node C finishes initial sync and the transaction is still prepared.
 *  - Node A commits the transaction.
 *
 * This ensures that we can correctly replicate prepare oplog entries that were received
