/**
 * Test that renaming a collection through $out takes database IX lock and will not be blocked by
 * transactions. This test is created to ensure that the scenario occuring in the case linked in
 * SERVER-72703, where a compact operation (which took an IX DB lock) blocked a rename with $out,
 * which required an exclusive DB lock. Now that $out should take an IX DB lock, renaming with
 * $out should not be blocked by operations taking an IX lock. Renaming with $out across
 * different databases still takes an X lock.
