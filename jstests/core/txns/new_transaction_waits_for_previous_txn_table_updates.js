/**
 * Tests that a new transaction on a session waits for the previous transaction's transaction table
 * write to be storage-committed before setting the read timestamp of readConcern: snapshot
 * transactions to the all_durable timestamp.
 *
 * This test creates a situation equivalent to the following:
 * 1. Thread 1 prepares txn0 at time 5
 * 2. Thread 2 starts new txn1 that blocks on txn0 since it is on the same session
 * 3. Thread 3 opens oplog hole at time 8 (createCollection)
 * 4. Thread 1 commits txn0 at time 6, but the commit oplog entry (and transaction table update) is
 * written at time 9
 * 5. On thread 2, txn1 should wait until txn0's transaction table update at time 9 becomes durable
 * so that when we open the storage transaction at the all_durable, we will open it at time 9
 * instead of time 7.
 *
 * If we did not wait, the latter would get a write conflict when writing to the txn table because
 * it's reading from time 7 and doesn't see the write from time 9.
