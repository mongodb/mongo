He is an M.A. in Assamese literature from Gauhati University and had been a teacher in the Nowgong College for most of his teaching career. He has now retired and lives at Nagaon. Bora spent a good part of his childhood in the culture-rich surroundings of rural Nagaon, where the river Kalong was the life-blood of a community. His impressionable mind was to capture a myriad memories of that childhood, later to find expression in his poems, short stories and novels with humour, irony and pathos woven into their texture. When this river was dammed up, its disturbing effect was on the entire community dependant on nature's bounty.",

A drover on horseback is attempting to turn the mob before they drown or crush each other in their desire to drink. The painting, an "icon of Australian art", is part of a series of works by Roberts that "captures what was an emerging spirit of national identity." Roberts painted the work at Corowa. The painting depicts a time of drought, with little grass and the soil kicked up as dust. The work itself is a reflection on the pioneering days of the pastoral industry, which were coming to an end by the 1890s.',
