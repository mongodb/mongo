/**
 * updateOne_update_queue_unindexed.js
 *
 * This is the same workload as updateOne_update_queue.js, but without the relevant index.
 *
 * The lack of an index that could satisfy the sort forces the updateOne operations to scan all
 * the matching documents in order to find the relevant document. This increases the amount of work
 * each updateOne operation has to do before getting to the matching document, and thus
 * increases the chance of a write conflict because each concurrent updateOne operation is
 * trying to update the same document from the queue.
 *
 * This test is modeled off of findAndModify_update_queue.js, but instead of storing the _id field
 * of the updated document in another database and ensuring that every thread updated a different
 * document from the other threads, we check that the correct number of documents were updated
 * because updateOne doesn't return the modified document (and its _id value) unless upsert is true.
