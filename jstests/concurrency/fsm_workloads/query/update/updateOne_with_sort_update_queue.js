/**
 * updateOne_update_queue.js
 *
 * A large number of documents are inserted during the workload setup. Each thread repeatedly
 * updates a document from the collection using the updateOne command with a sort. At the end of the
 * workload, the contents of the database are checked for whether the correct number of documents
 * were updated. They are also checked to ensure that the modified documents were those that came
 * first in the sort order (for a descending sort, the documents that had the highest sortField
 * values). While sortField is modified by the update, the document's _id value is the same as its
 * old sortField value, so we check the value at _id instead.
 *
 * This test is modeled off of findAndModify_update_queue.js, but instead of storing the _id field
 * of the updated document in another database and ensuring that every thread updated a different
 * document from the other threads, we check that the correct number of documents were updated
 * because updateOne doesn't return the modified document (and its _id value) unless upsert is true.
