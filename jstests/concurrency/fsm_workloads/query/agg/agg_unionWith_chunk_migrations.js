/**
 * agg_unionWith_chunk_migrations.js
 *
 * This tests exercises aggregations using $unionWith on a collection during chunk migrations. The
 * $unionWith stage is expected to internally retry the sub-queries during a chunk migration to
 * complete seamlessly.
 *
 * $config.data.collWithMigrations: collection to run chunk migrations against (default is the
 * collection of the aggregation itself).
 * $config.state.aggregate: function to execute the aggregation.
 *
 * @tags: [
 *  requires_sharding,
 *  assumes_balancer_on,
 *  requires_non_retryable_writes,
 *  requires_getmore,
 *  # The $unionWith stage cannot be run within a transaction. Therefore the original aggregation
 *  # and subsequent getMores will be run outside a transaction.
