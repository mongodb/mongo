/**
 * Tests $out stage of aggregate command concurrently with killOp. Ensures that all the temporary
 * collections created during aggreate command are deleted. If extending this workload, consider
 * overriding the following:
 * - $config.states.aggregate: The function to execute the aggregation.
 * - $config.states.killOp: The function to find the aggregation and kill it. Consider reusing
 *   $config.data.killOpsMatchingFilter to do the deed.
 * - $config.teardown: If you want any assertion to make sure nothing got leaked or left behind by
 *   the interrupted aggregation.
