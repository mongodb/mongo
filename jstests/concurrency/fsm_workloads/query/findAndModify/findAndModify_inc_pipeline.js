 * This is the same workload as findAndModify_inc.js, but substitutes a $mod-style update with a

 *
 * This workload implicitly assumes that its tid ranges are [0, $config.threadCount). This
 * isn't guaranteed to be true when they are run in parallel with other workloads. Therefore
 * it can't be run in concurrency simultaneous suites.
