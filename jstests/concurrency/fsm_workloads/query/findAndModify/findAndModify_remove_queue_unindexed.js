/**
 * findAndModify_remove_queue_unindexed.js
 *
 * This is the same workload as findAndModify_remove_queue.js, but without the relevant index.
 *
 * The lack of an index that could satisfy the sort forces the findAndModify operations to scan all
 * the matching documents in order to find the relevant document. This increases the amount of work
 * each findAndModify operation has to do before getting to the matching document, and thus
 * increases the chance of a write conflict because each concurrent findAndModify operation is
 * trying to remove the same document from the queue.
 *
 * This workload was designed to reproduce SERVER-21434.
 *
 * @tags: [
 *   # PM-1632 was delivered in 7.1.
