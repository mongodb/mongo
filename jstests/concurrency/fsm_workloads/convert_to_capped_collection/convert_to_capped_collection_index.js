/**
 * convert_to_capped_collection_index.js
 *
 * Creates a non-capped collection. Converts it to a
 * capped collection. After each iteration, truncates the
 * collection, ensuring that the storage size of the
 * collection is still a multiple of 256.
 *
 * MongoDB raises the storage size of a capped collection
 * to an integer multiple of 256.
 *
 * Make sure that we can create indexes on any collection
 * but that only the _id index remains after (re-)converting
 * to a capped collection.
 *
