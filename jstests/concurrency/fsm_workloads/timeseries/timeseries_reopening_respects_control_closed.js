/**
 * Extends timeseries_crud_operations_respect_control_closed.js to focus on conflicting reopening
 * requests and direct writes to set the control.closed field to true.
 *
 * This test tests that concurrent user inserts, which may try to reopen buckets to insert into,
 * respect the control.closed:true field and do not write to closed buckets. Buckets that we attempt
 * to reopen but which we write directly to in between beginning our reopening request and actually
 * reopening them should fail to be reopened.
