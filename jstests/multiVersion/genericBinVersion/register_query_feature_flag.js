/**
 * In the case of accumulators or window functions registered with feature flags, this test verifies
 * that they throw a query feature not allowed error when their registered fcv is downgraded.
 *
 * For example: in this test, $concatArrays is registered as an accumulator and window function
 * under the feature flag gFeatureFlagArrayAccumulators which is gated under FCV 8.1. If the FCV is
 * downgraded to a version where the query feature is not allowed, then this should be caught at
 * runtime instead of parsetime.
