/**
 * This test simulates a scenario when you're upgrading/downgrading an extension between V1 and V2
 * while maintaining the same server version. For the sake of testing, $testFoo in V1 must provide
 * an empty stage definition like {$testFoo: {}} or it will reject the query at parsing; $testFoo in
 * V2 loosens those restrictions. We test this expected behavior for upgrade:
 *     - The nodes are spun up with extension V1 loaded. $testFoo is accepted in queries and views,
 *       but it is always rejected (in queries and views) with a non-empty stage definition.
 *     - In a ReplSet, $testFoo V1 queries must be accepted the whole time. $testFoo V2 queries
 *       are only accepted once all binaries are upgraded (the primary last). Note that we are
 *       missing coverage for ReplSet upgrade/downgrade where we aren't just connected to the
 *       primary the whole time (TODO SERVER-109457).
 *     - In a sharded cluster, again $testFoo V1 queries must be accepted the whole time, and
 *       $testFoo V2 queries are only accepted once all binaries are upgraded (the mongos last).
 *        * However, there is one difference: in the period between when the shards start restarting
 *          until mongos has restarted, the cluster may allow you to create a view with $testFoo V2
 *          even though you cannot run queries on the view until mongos has upgraded. This behavior
 *          is flaky, as it occasionally rejects the view creation to begin with. Note that this
 *          only happens when auth is not enabled (see extension_foo_upgrade_downgrade_auth.js for
 *          testing with more consistent behavior when auth is enabled).
 *     - The downgrade behavior is reverse and more consistent (no flaky view issues).
 *
 * This test is technically not multiversion since we only use latest binaries, but it stays with
 * multiversion tests since we use the upgrade/downgrade library utils.
 *
 * TODO SERVER-109457 Investigate more ReplSet scenarios.
 *
 * TODO SERVER-109450 Auth-off cluster should have same behavior as auth-on cluster.
 * Extensions are only available on Linux machines.
 * @tags: [
 *   auth_incompatible,
 *   incompatible_with_macos,
 *   incompatible_with_windows_tls,
 * ]
