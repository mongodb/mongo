/**
 * Creating a collection with a validator with expressions that are enabled on 8.1+ can interleave
 * with FCV downgrade, such that the primary checks the query feature flag on FCV 8.1+ and
 * successfully creates the collection. Then an oplog entry is committed with the new query feature
 * in the validator. The secondary will try to apply the oplog entry on the downgraded FCV and fail
 * to create the collection since the validator fails to parse.
 *
 * The secondary must not check feature flags when applying oplog entries and parsing expressions.
