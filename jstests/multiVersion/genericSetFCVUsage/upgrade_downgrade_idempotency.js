/**
 * Tests the idempotency of the 'setFeatureCompatibilityVersion' command.
 * We execute the following steps for both upgrade and downgrade:
 * 1. Enable a failpoint to fail upgrading/downgrading.
 * 2. Issue a setFeatureCompatibilityVersion command, which upgrades/downgrades
 *    the replica set to a kUpgrading/kDowngrading intermediary state.
 * 3. The setFeatureCompatibilityVersion command fails without completing all
 *    upgrade/downgrade behavior.
 * 4. Disable the failpoint, and issue a succesful setFeatureCompatibilityVersion
 *    to finish upgrading/downgrading.
