/**
 * SERVER-6121: aggregation framework converts Timestamp to long long in result set
 *
 * This test validates the SERVER-6121 ticket. Add support for timestamps to Aggregation and
 * ensure they can do everything dates can. Previously timestamps were awkwardly used as dates
 * and long longs.
 */

/*
 * 1) Clear and create testing db
 * 2) Run an aggregation with all date expressions on a timestamp and a date
 * 3) Run an aggregation that will show timestamp and date can be compared
 * 4) Run an aggregation comparing two timestamps to show inc matters
