// Specifically, before SERVER-47848 we assumed that the consumer of a pipeline might depend on
// textScore if all the stages preserve it. We made that assumption because in a sharded cluster,
// when a merger sends the shardsPart of a pipeline to the shards, it doesn't specify whether it
// depends on textScore. After SERVER-47848, we refined that assumption: the shard can tell whether
// the consumer is a merger by looking at needsMerge. If the consumer is not a merger, there won't
// be an implicit dependency on textScore.
