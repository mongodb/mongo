// This test was designed to reproduce SERVER-59435. A $lookup sub-pipeline which is entirely
// uncorrelated can have its results be cached and re-used for subsequent $lookups. To do this we
// insert a special caching stage in the $lookup sub-pipeline at a place where everything "in front
// of it" or "to the left" is uncorrelated (the same for each lookup). For the first lookup, the
// cache just sits there and collects results. In the second lookup it is inserted in the same way
// to the new pipeline (which may be different if there were correlated pieces that need to be
// updated on each lookup), and then after being inserted it *deletes* the prefix of the pipeline
// which is no longer needed because the results will now come from the cache. There was a bug where
// this deletion happened in a state where the pipeline was not prepared for destruction and
// followed an old/invalid pointer. This test case reproduces the scenario that discovered this bug
// and is simply designed to demonstrate that we no longer crash.
