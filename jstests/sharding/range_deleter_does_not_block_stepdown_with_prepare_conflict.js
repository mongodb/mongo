/**
 * Test to make sure that range deleter deletions blocked on prepare conflicts do not prevent
 * stepdown from occuring.
 *
 * Layout:
 * 1. Shard a collection and split it into two chunks, both of which live on shard 0.
 * 2. Pause range deletion.
 * 3. Move one chunk from shard 0 to shard 1.
 * 4. In a transaction, insert a document into the chunk that remains on shard 0.
 * 5. Put the transaction into prepare.
 * 6. Resume the range deleter. The range deletion task should block behind the prepared
 * transaction.
 * 7. Attempt a step down. This step down should kill the range deleter operation and succeed.
