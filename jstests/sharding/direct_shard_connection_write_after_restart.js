/**
 * Test that write operations succeed when using a direct connection against a freshly restarted
 * shard. Direct connections to a shard are expected for a time period for users who are in the
 * process of migrating from a replica set to a one-shard cluster. The cluster may become sharded
 * before the application starts to connect to mongos rather than the shard.
 *
 * When the shard is restarted, its in-memory filtering metadata is unknown and needs to
 * be recovered from the config server. In this case, writes issued directly against the shard may
 * fail with a StaleConfig error. However, this causes mongod to refresh its filtering metadata. As
 * a result, the StaleConfig error is transient and the write may be retried by the client.
 *
 * This test was originally written to reproduce SERVER-95244.
 *
 * @tags: [
 *   # This test restarts a shard and expects its state to persist after restart.
 *   requires_persistence,
