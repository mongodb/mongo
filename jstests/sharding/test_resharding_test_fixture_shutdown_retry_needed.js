/**
 * Test for the ReshardingTest fixture itself.
 *
 * Verifies that the background thread running the reshardCollection command will retry when mongos
 * reports an error caused by a network error from the primary shard.
 *
 * Incompatible with a config shard because it uses a sequence of fail points to test the
 * resharding test fixture, which doesn't work when the first shard is the config server. This only
 * tests the testing fixture, so it wouldn't add meaningful coverage for a config shard.
