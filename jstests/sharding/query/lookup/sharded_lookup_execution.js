/**
 * Tests the behavior of a $lookup in a sharded environment. These include tests where the 'from'
 * collection is sharded when the local collection is sharded and unsharded, when the $lookup
 * subpipeline can target certain shards or is scatter-gather, and when the $lookup subpipeline
 * contains a nested $lookup stage. This also includes tests when the mongos has stale information
 * about the foreign collection.
 *
 * Shard targeting logic for $lookup changed in 7.3 and may not match the expected behavior in a
 * multiversion environment.
