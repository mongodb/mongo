"""Mongot fixture for executing JSTests against.

Mongot is a MongoDB-specific process written as a wrapper around Lucene. Using Lucene, mongot indexes MongoDB databases to provide our customers with full text search capabilities.

Customers have the option of running mongot on Atlas or locally using a special "local-dev" binary of mongot. The local-dev binary allows mongot and mongod to speak directly on the localhost, rather than via proprietary network proxies configured by the Atlas Data Plane.

A resmoke suite's yml definition can enable launching mongot(s) enabled via the launch_mongot option on the ReplicaSetFixture and providing a keyfile. If enabled, the ReplicaSetFixture launches a local-dev version of mongot per mongod node. The mongot replicates directly from the co-located
mongod via a $changeStream.
