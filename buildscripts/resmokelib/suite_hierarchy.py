# Represents a DAG describing the complexity of suites. As we go deeper into the graph,
# suites get simpler. For example, suppose we have suite_A and suite_A_B, where suite_A_B
# tests a strict superset of *features* (not tests) tested by suite_A. Then, the graph
# would contain:
# {
#    suite_A_B: {
#       suite_A: {}
#    }
# }
#
# But suppose feature_B changed the interaction with the server fundamentally - for example,
# if feature_B was retryable writes - then in this case suite_A_B would not be a strict superset
# of the features tested by suite_A. In this case, suite_A_B cannot be considered more complex
# than suite_A; the two are incomparable.
