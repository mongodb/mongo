description: >-
  Test the correctness of query settings application by replacing index filter commands with query settings ones. This suite runs a select subset of jscore tests on a sharded cluster fixture which implicitly shards accessed collections.
  For testing purposes, SetQuerySettingsCommand and RemoveQuerySettingsCommand clear the plan cache
  upon successful command exectution. However, since only the SBE plan cache is cleared (classic
  cache is untouched), this suite can only be run with 'internalQueryFrameworkControl' server
  parameter set to 'trySbeEngine'.
