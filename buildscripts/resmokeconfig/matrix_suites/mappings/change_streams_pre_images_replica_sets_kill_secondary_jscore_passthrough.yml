# This suite tests that secondaries getting abruptly killed while performing preimage removal do
# not display consistency holes when recovering. The primary is prevented from performing any
# removal so that a secondary containing a hole is detected as the documents when read in descending
# order (most recent -> oldest) wouldn't match.
