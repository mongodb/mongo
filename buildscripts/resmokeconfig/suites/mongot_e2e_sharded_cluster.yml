description: |
  This suite spins up a two node sharded cluster with atlas search enabled, consisting of a
  mongos, two mongods and two mongots. Unlike the mongot_e2e_sharded_collections suite,
  collections are not implicitly sharded by test infrastructure.

selector:
  # IMPORTANT: THIS SUITE IS OPT-IN ONLY.
  # We do _not_ select all the tests in the e2e directory. We assume that the hot path taken for
  # queries in this suite matches the hot path taken in the mongot_e2e_single_shard suite,
  # so we don't need to repeat coverage.
