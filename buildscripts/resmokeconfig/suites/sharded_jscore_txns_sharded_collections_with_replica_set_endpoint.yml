# This suite is based on the sharded_jscore_txns_sharded_collections passthrough suite. It is used
# for testing that on a single-shard cluster there is no feature parity issue between connecting to
# a mongos or the router port of a mongod and connecting to the shard port of a mongod with replica
# set endpoint enabled. When feature parity is achieved, the set of tests disabled in this suite
# should be the same as the set of tests disabled in the sharded_jscore_txns_sharded_collections
# passthrough suite.
