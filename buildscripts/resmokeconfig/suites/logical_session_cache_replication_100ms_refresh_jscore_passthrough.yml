  # The awaitdata_getmore_cmd.js test tails the oplog and waits for the getMore batch size to equal
  # zero. The CheckReplDBHashInBackground hook consistently runs and creates sessions. At the same
  # time, the logical session cache refresh thread will flush these sessions to disk, creating more
  # opLog entries. To avoid this infinite loop, we will blacklist the test from this suite.
