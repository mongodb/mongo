  This suite enables the collection of telemetry metrics on a mongod server, then runs the tests in
  core and aggregation as normal. This should cause each query or aggregation to compute a query
  shape and telemetry key, and record in-memory some metrics like execution time and number of
  scanned documents. It doesn't assert anything about the collected telemetry, it is just meant to
  make sure nothing is going seriously awry (e.g. crashing).
