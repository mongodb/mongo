# This suite is based on the replica_sets_jscore passthrough suite. It is used for testing that
# there is no feature parity issue between a replica set before and after it has been bootstrapped
# as a single-shard cluster as long as the replica set endpoint is enabled. When feature parity is
# achieved, the set of tests disabled in this suite should be the same as the set of tests disabled
# in the replica_sets_jscore passthrough suite.

    # These tests utilize 'fsyncLock' and subsequently wait for an insert operation to be blocked by
    # checking the inprogress 'currentOp', leading to a deadlock with the dbCheck process:
    # When the fsyncLock is activated, multiple threads acquire writeTickets and become stalled at the
    # Flusher stage. Consequently, other threads are unable to obtain additional tickets.
    # In this context, the behavior of the dbcheck process involves acquiring writeTickets in an
    # attempt to write to the oplog, followed by becoming blocked at the flusher stage. Consequently,
    # when an insertion is initiated from the test, it is unable to find available writeTickets and
    # enters a wait state. Additionally, since the AquireCollection is not even obtained,
    # the curOp (current operation) does not get logged.

    # within it from being read by the dbcheck process. Therefore, if the test keeps the transaction
