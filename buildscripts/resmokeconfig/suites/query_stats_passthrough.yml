  This suite enables the collection of query stats metrics on a mongod server, then runs the tests in
  core and aggregation as normal. This should cause each query or aggregation to compute a query
  shape and query stats key, and record in-memory some metrics like execution time and number of
  scanned documents. Then it uses the 'RunQueryStats' hook to have a background thread ask to collect
  the query stats every one second. It doesn't assert anything about the collected query stats, it is
  just meant to make sure nothing is going seriously awry (e.g. crashing).
