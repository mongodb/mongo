  # Due to background tenant migrations, operations in the main test shell are not guaranteed to
  # be causally consistent with operations in a parallel shell. The reason is that
  # TenantMigrationCommitted error is only thrown when the client does a write or a atClusterTime/
  # afterClusterTime or linearlizable read. Therefore, one of shell may not be aware that the
  # migration has occurred and would not forward the read/write command to the right replica set.
