  This suite runs tests that are targeted for extensions against a two node sharded cluster. It
  assumes that extensions (and the corresponding .so files) have already been installed with
  'install-extensions'. This suite spins up a mongos and two mongods. Unlike the
  extensions_sharded_collections suite, collections are not implicitly sharded by the test
  infrastructure.
