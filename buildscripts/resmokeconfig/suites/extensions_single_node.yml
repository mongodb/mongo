description: |
  This suite runs tests that are targeted for extensions against a single node replica set (eg a
  single, primary node). It assumes that extensions (and the corresponding .so files) have already
  been installed with 'install-extensions'. Given that it is a single replica set node, the suite's
  read preference is the primary.
