# This suite is based on the concurrency_replication_metrics suite. It is used for testing that
# there is no feature parity issue between a replica set before and after it has been bootstrapped
# as a single-shard cluster as long as the replica set endpoint is enabled. When feature parity is
# achieved, the set of tests disabled in this suite should be the same as the set of tests disabled
# in the concurrency_replication_metrics suite.
