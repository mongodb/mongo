    # Disabled due to MongoDB restrictions and/or workload restrictions

    # These workloads sometimes trigger 'Could not lock auth data update lock'
    # errors because the AuthorizationManager currently waits for only five
    # seconds to acquire the lock for authorization documents

    # uses >100MB of data, which can overwhelm test hosts

    # compact can only be run against a standalone mongod

    # can cause OOM kills on test hosts

    # cannot createIndex after dropDatabase without sharding first

    # The WTWriteConflictException failpoint is not supported on mongos.

    # TODO Undenylist (SERVER-38852).

    # serverStatus does not include transaction metrics on mongos.

    # Uses the same transaction id across different routers, which is not allowed because when either
    # router tries to commit, it may not know the full participant list.

    # The test may spuriously fail when run against sharded clusters, due to limitations of the
    # infrastructure. See SERVER-77039 for full details.

    # This test runs a large number of inserts, which can cause moveCollection to take a long time
    # to finish. This can cause the CheckMetadataConsistency hook to hit LockBusy errors.
