  # Will always fail on last-stable. In order for the test to succeed, the setFCV
  # command has to reach the shards. Since the cluster will already be
  # running in fully downgraded version, the config server won't forward the

  # mongos. This should be removed and the test can be adjusted and re-added to this passthrough.

  # meaning that either the test will stall, or mongos will crash due to connecting to an upgraded
  # FCV cluster.
