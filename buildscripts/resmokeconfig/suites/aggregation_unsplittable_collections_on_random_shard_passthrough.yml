  # These tests are written such that, after we check the engine being used and the colocation of
  # the involved collections, we drop and recreate our collections for each test case. Given that
  # this suite creates unsplittable collections on random shards and we cannot reliably check the
  # colocation of collections in these tests, this means that these tests are incompatible with
  # this suite as written.
