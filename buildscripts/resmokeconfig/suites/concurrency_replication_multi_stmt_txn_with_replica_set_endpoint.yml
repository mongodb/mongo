# This suite is based on the concurrency_replication_multi_stmt_txn suite. It is used for testing
# that there is no feature parity issue between a replica set before and after it has been
# bootstrapped as a single-shard cluster as long as the replica set endpoint is enabled. When
# feature parity is achieved, the set of tests disabled in this suite should be the same as the
# set of tests disabled in the concurrency_replication_multi_stmt_txn suite.
