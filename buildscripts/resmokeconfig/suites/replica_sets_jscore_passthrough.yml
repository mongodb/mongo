  # These tests fails while DbCheck running in the background:
  # The DBCheck process continuously populates the currentOp, causing this test to time out while
  # waiting for empty 'getMore' requests.
  - jstests/core/query/awaitdata_getmore_cmd.js
  # These tests utilize 'fsyncLock' and subsequently wait for an insert operation to be blocked by
  # checking the inprogress 'currentOp', leading to a deadlock with the dbCheck process:
  # When the fsyncLock is activated, multiple threads acquire writeTickets and become stalled at the
  # Flusher stage. Consequently, other threads are unable to obtain additional tickets.
  # In this context, the behavior of the dbcheck process involves acquiring writeTickets in an
  # attempt to write to the oplog, followed by becoming blocked at the flusher stage. Consequently,
  # when an insertion is initiated from the test, it is unable to find available writeTickets and
  # enters a wait state. Additionally, since the AquireCollection is not even obtained,
  # the curOp (current operation) does not get logged.

  - jstests/core/fsync.js
  # When a transaction is in a prepared state, as seen in that test, it prevents the document edited
  # within it from being read by the dbcheck process. Therefore, if the test keeps the transaction
  # in a prepared state for an extended period, it will result in a timeout for the dbcheck process.
