    # These tests fails while DbCheck running in the background:
    # The DBCheck process continuously populates the currentOp, causing this test to time out while
    # waiting for empty 'getMore' requests.

    # These tests utilize 'fsyncLock' and subsequently wait for an insert operation to be blocked by
    # checking the inprogress 'currentOp', leading to a deadlock with the dbCheck process:
    # When the fsyncLock is activated, multiple threads acquire writeTickets and become stalled at the
    # Flusher stage. Consequently, other threads are unable to obtain additional tickets.
    # In this context, the behavior of the dbcheck process involves acquiring writeTickets in an
    # attempt to write to the oplog, followed by becoming blocked at the flusher stage. Consequently,
    # when an insertion is initiated from the test, it is unable to find available writeTickets and
    # enters a wait state. Additionally, since the AquireCollection is not even obtained,
    # the curOp (current operation) does not get logged.

    # When a transaction is in a prepared state, as seen in that test, it prevents the document edited
    # within it from being read by the dbcheck process. Therefore, if the test keeps the transaction
    # in a prepared state for an extended period, it will result in a timeout for the dbcheck process.

    # This test expects that the connection (i.e. 'threadName') does not change throughout each test
    # case. That is not always true when the test driver use a replica set connection string. As this
    # test sets fail point with error code NotWritablePrimary, the test driver changes its topology to
    # ReplicaSetNoPrimary and create a new connection once it get the primary again.
