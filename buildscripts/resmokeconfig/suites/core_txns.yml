# This test suite exercises core, generic transactions behavior. The tests in this suite, pulled
# from 'jstests/core/txns', should be "topology agnostic". They ideally generalize to single replica
# sets and sharded clusters. Since transactions aren't supported on MongoDB standalones in 4.0, we
# run this set of tests in their own suite, against a 1-node replica set, to provide the most basic
# layer of test coverage. This allows us to verify basic transaction behavior against a local node,
# without the need to exercise data replication machinery.
