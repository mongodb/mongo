# This suite is based on the sharding_jscore_passthrough suite. It is used for testing that on a
# single-shard cluster there is no feature parity issue between connecting to a mongos or the router
# port of a mongod and connecting to the shard port of a mongod with replica set endpoint enabled.
# When feature parity is achieved, the set of tests disabled in this suite should be the same as
# the set of tests disabled in the sharded_jscore_txns passthrough suite.
