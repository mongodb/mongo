# This test suite runs the tests in aggregation with 'rerun_queries.js' override and
# internalQueryPlannerUseMultiplannerForSingleSolutions query knob enabled. By rerunning
# queries multiple times, this tests that any caches involved in query processing -- in particular
# the plan cache -- do not affect correctness. By running multiplanning even when there is a
# single solution, this tests adds more plans to the cache and increases multiplanning and
# replanning test coverage.
