  This suite enables the collection of query stats metrics on a mongod server, then runs the tests in
  aggregation as normal. This should cause each aggregation to compute a query
  shape and query stats key, and record in-memory some metrics like execution time and number of
  scanned documents. Then it uses the 'RunQueryStats' hook to collect the query stats at the end of
  each test, once with HMAC application enabled and once without. It doesn't assert anything about
  the collected query stats, it is just meant to make sure nothing is going seriously awry (e.g.
  crashing).
