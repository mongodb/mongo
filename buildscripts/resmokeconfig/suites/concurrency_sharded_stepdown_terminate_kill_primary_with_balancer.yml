    # SERVER-14669 Multi-removes that use $where miscount removed documents

    # Disabled because MapReduce can lose cursors if the primary goes down during the operation.

    # Disabled due to MongoDB restrictions and/or workload restrictions

    # These workloads sometimes trigger 'Could not lock auth data update lock'
    # errors because the AuthorizationManager currently waits for only five
    # seconds to acquire the lock for authorization documents

    # uses >100MB of data, which can overwhelm test hosts

    # compact can only be run against a standalone mongod

    # can cause OOM kills on test hosts

    # cannot createIndex after dropDatabase without sharding first

    # The WTWriteConflictException failpoint is not supported on mongos.

    # SERVER-20361 Improve the behaviour of multi-update/delete against a sharded collection

    # ChunkHelper directly talks to the config servers and doesn't support retries for network errors

    # These workloads frequently time out waiting for the distributed lock to drop a sharded
    # collection.

    # Uses getmores.

    # Uses non retryable writes.

    # Uses non retryable commands.

    # much value in running it.

    # serverStatus does not include transaction metrics on mongos.

    # Uses the same transaction id across different routers, which is not allowed because when either
    # router tries to commit, it may not know the full participant list.

    # Use non-retryable commands not allowed by the network retry helper.

    # This test runs a large number of inserts, which can cause moveCollection to take a long time
    # to finish. This can cause the CheckMetadataConsistency hook to hit LockBusy errors.
