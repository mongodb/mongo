  # This test does a very large amount of inserts on a single shard which will trigger the balancer.
  # If we disable the balancer on the source cluster then it will remain enabled on the restore
  # nodes and still cause a diff. This is because the config shard needs to connect to its replica
  # set to apply the stashed balancer mode and we are unable to do that since we are running the
  # config server node on a different port than the configuration we pass in. We will have a
  # targeted test that handles this case for correctness.
