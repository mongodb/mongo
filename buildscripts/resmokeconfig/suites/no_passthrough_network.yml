  "Passthrough" means running a test against different runtime Cluster
  configurations, including topology, runtime flags, fault injections, and other
  parameters. Most tests by default are able to run in "passthrough" suites.
  NoPassthrough is an exception, where tests here only run in the exact
  configuration predefined in the tests themselves. This variant runs the
  noPassthroughs in the architecture/ folder.
