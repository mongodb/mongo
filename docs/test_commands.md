# Test Commands

All test commands are denoted with the `.testOnly()` modifier to the `MONGO_REGISTER_COMMAND` invocation.
For example:

```c++
MONGO_REGISTER_COMMAND(EchoCommand).testOnly();
```

## How to enable

To be able to run these commands, the server must be started with the `enableTestCommands=1`
server parameter (e.g. `--setParameter enableTestCommands=1`). Resmoke.py often sets this server
parameter for testing.

## Examples

Some often-used commands that are test-only:

- [configureFailPoint][fail_point_cmd]
- [replSetTest][repl_set_test_cmd]
- [sleep][sleep_cmd]

As a very rough estimate, about 10% of all server commands are test-only. These additional commands
will appear in `db.runCommand({listCommands: 1})` when the server has test commands enabled.
