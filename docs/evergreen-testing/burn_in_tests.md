# burn_in_tests

## What it is

`burn_in_tests` detects the javascript tests (under the
[jstests directory](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/master/jstests)) that are new or have changed
since the last git command and then runs those tests in repeated mode to validate their stability.

## How to use it

You can use `burn_in_tests` on evergreen by selecting the `burn_in_tests_gen` task when creating a patch,
since `burn_in_tests` task is a [generated task](task_generation.md) generated by the
[mongo-task-generator](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-task-generator).
`burn_in_tests` task will be generated on each of the applicable build variants, and
may have multiple sub-tasks which run the test suites only for the new or changed javascript tests (note
that a javascript test can be included in multiple test suites). Each of those tests will be run 2 times
minimum, and 1000 times maximum or for 10 minutes, whichever is reached first.

You can also use `burn_in_tests` locally from within the [mongo repo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)
by running the script `python buildscripts/burn_in_tests.py`. For more information about this usage, you can
run `python buildscripts/burn_in_tests.py --help`.
