# burn_in_tests

## What it is

`burn_in_tests` detects the javascript tests (under the
[jstests directory](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/master/jstests)) that are new, or have changed, or depend (import code) on those new or changed
files since the last git command and then runs those tests in repeated mode to validate their stability.

## How to use it

You can use `burn_in_tests` on evergreen by selecting the `burn_in_tests_gen` task when creating a patch,
since `burn_in_tests` task is a [generated task](task_generation.md) generated by the
[mongo-task-generator](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-task-generator).
`burn_in_tests` task will be generated on each of the applicable build variants, and
may have multiple sub-tasks which run the test suites only for the new, or changed, or those that depend
(import code) on new or changed javascript tests (note that a javascript test can be included in multiple
test suites). Each of those tests will be run 2 times minimum, and 1000 times maximum or for 10 minutes,
whichever is reached first.

You can also use `burn_in_tests` locally from within the [mongo repo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)
by running the script `python buildscripts/burn_in_tests.py`. For more information about this usage, you can
run `python buildscripts/burn_in_tests.py --help`.
