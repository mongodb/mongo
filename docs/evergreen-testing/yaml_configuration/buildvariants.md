# Build Variants

This document describes build variants (a.k.a. variants, or builds, or buildvariants) that are used in `mongodb-mongo-*` projects.
To know more about build variants, please refer to the [Build Variants](https://docs.devprod.prod.corp.mongodb.com/evergreen/Project-Configuration/Project-Configuration-Files#build-variants) section of the Evergreen wiki.

## YAML files structure

Build variant configuration files are in `etc/evergreen_yml_components/variants` directory.
They are merged into `etc/evergreen.yml` and `etc/evergreen_nightly.yml` with Evergreen's [include](https://docs.devprod.prod.corp.mongodb.com/evergreen/Project-Configuration/Project-Configuration-Files#include) feature.

Inside `etc/evergreen_yml_components/variants` directory there are more directories,
which are in most cases platform names (e.g. amazon, rhel etc.) or build variant group names (e.g. sanitizer etc.).

Be aware that some of these files could be also used or re-used to be merged into `etc/system_perf.yml` which is used for `sys-perf` project.

## Build Variants in `mongodb-mongo-master` and `mongodb-mongo-master-nightly`

`mongodb-mongo-master` evergreen project uses `etc/evergreen.yml` and contains all build variants for development, including all feature-specific, patch build required, and suggested variants.

`mongodb-mongo-master-nightly` evergreen project uses `etc/evergreen_nightly.yml` and contains build variants for public nightly builds.

## Required and Suggested Build Variants

"Required" build variants are defined as any build variant with a `!` at the front of its display name in Evergreen.
These build variants also have `required` tag.

[Required Patch Builds Policy](https://wiki.corp.mongodb.com/display/KERNEL/Required+Patch+Builds+Policy)

"Suggested" build variants are defined as any build variant with a `*` at the front of its display name in Evergreen.
These build variants also have `suggested` tag.

## Build Variants with forbid_tasks_tagged_with_experimental

Build variants with the `forbid_tasks_tagged_with_experimental` tag indicate that they do not allow tasks tagged as `experimental` to run. This tag is used in conjunction with the `forbid-tasks-with-tag-on-variants` evergreen lint rule to enforce this restriction.

## Build Variants after branching

In each of platform or build variant group directory there can be these files:

- `test_dev.yml`

  - these files are merged into `etc/evergreen.yml` which is used for `mongodb-mongo-master` project on master branch
  - after branching on all new branches these files are merged into `etc/evergreen_nightly.yml` which is used for a new branch `mongodb-mongo-vX.Y` project

- `test_dev_master_and_lts_branches_only.yml`

  - these files are merged into `etc/evergreen.yml` which is used for `mongodb-mongo-master` project on master branch
  - after branching for LTS release (v7.0, v8.0 etc.) on a new branch these files are merged into `etc/evergreen_nightly.yml` which is used for a new branch `mongodb-mongo-vX.Y` project
  - **important**: all tests that are running on these build variants will NOT run on a new Rapid release (v7.1, v7.2, v7.3, v8.1, v8.2, v8.3 etc.) branch projects

- `test_dev_master_branch_only.yml`

  - these files are merged into `etc/evergreen.yml` which is used for `mongodb-mongo-master` project on master branch
  - after branching on all new branches these files are NOT used
  - **important**: all tests that are running on these build variants will NOT run on a new branch `mongodb-mongo-vX.Y` project

- `test_release.yml`

  - these files are merged into `etc/evergreen_nightly.yml` which is used for `mongodb-mongo-master-nightly` project on master branch
  - after branching on all new branches these files are merged into `etc/evergreen_nightly.yml` which is used for a new branch `mongodb-mongo-vX.Y` project

- `test_release_master_and_lts_branches_only.yml`

  - these files are merged into `etc/evergreen_nightly.yml` which is used for `mongodb-mongo-master-nightly` project on master branch
  - after branching for LTS release (v7.0, v8.0 etc.) on a new branch these files are merged into `etc/evergreen_nightly.yml` which is used for a new branch `mongodb-mongo-vX.Y` project
  - **important**: all tests that are running on these build variants will NOT run on a new Rapid release (v7.1, v7.2, v7.3, v8.1, v8.2, v8.3 etc.) branch projects

- `test_release_master_branch_only.yml`

  - these files are merged into `etc/evergreen_nightly.yml` which is used for `mongodb-mongo-master-nightly` project on master branch
  - after branching on all new branches these files are NOT used
  - **important**: all tests that are running on these build variants will NOT run on a new branch `mongodb-mongo-vX.Y` project
