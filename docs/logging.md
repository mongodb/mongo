# Log System Overview

The new log system adds capability to produce structured logs in the [Relaxed
Extended JSON 2.0.0][relaxed_json_2] format. The new API requires names to be
given to variables, forming field names for the variables in structured JSON
logs. Named variables are called attributes in the log system.

# Style guide

## In general

Log lines are composed primarily of a message (`msg`) and attributes (`attr` fields).

## Philosophy

As you write log messages, keep the following in mind: A big thing that makes
JSON and BSON useful as data formats is the ability to provide rich field names.

What makes logv2 machine readable is that we write an intact Extended BSON
format.

But, what makes these lines human readable is that the `msg` provides a simple,
clear context for interpreting well-formed field names and values in the `attr`
subdocument.

## Specific Guidance

For maximum readability, a log message additionally has the least amount of
repetition possible, and shares attribute names with other related log lines.

### Message (the msg field)

The `msg` field predicates a reader's interpretation of the log line. It should
be crafted with care and attention.

- Concisely describe what the log line is reporting, providing enough
  context necessary for interpreting attribute field names and values
- Capitalize the first letter, as in a sentence
- Avoid unnecessary punctuation, but punctuate between sentences if using
  multiple sentences
- Do not conclude with punctuation
- You may occasionally encounter `msg` strings containing fmt-style
  `{expr}` braces. These are legacy artifacts and should be rephrased
  according to these guidelines.

### Attributes (fields in the attr subdocument)

The `attr` subdocument includes important metrics/statistics about the logged
event for the purposes of debugging or performance analysis. These variables
should be named very well, as though intended for a very human-readable portion
of the codebase (like config variable declaration, abstract class definitions,
etc.)

For `attr` field names, do the following:

#### Use camelCased words understandable in the context of the message (msg)

The bar for understanding should be:

- Someone with reasonable understanding of mongod behavior should understand
  immediately what is being logged
- Someone with reasonable troubleshooting skill should be able to extract doc-
  or code-searchable phrases to learn about what is being logged

#### Precisely describe values and units

Exception: Do not add a unit suffix when logging a Duration type. The system
automatically adds this unit.

#### When providing an execution time attribute, ensure it is named "durationMillis"

To describe the execution time of an operation using our preferred method:
Specify an `attr` name of “duration” and provide a value using the Milliseconds
Duration type. The log system will automatically append "Millis" to the
attribute name.

Alternatively, specify an `attr` name of “durationMillis” and provide the
number of milliseconds as an integer type.

**Importantly**: downstream analysis tools will rely on this convention, as a
replacement for the "[0-9]+ms$" format of prior logs.

#### Use certain specific terms whenever possible

When logging the below information, do so with these specific terms:

- **namespace** - when logging a value of the form
  "\<db name\>.\<collection name\>". Do not use "collection" or abbreviate to "ns"
- **db** - instead of "database"
- **error** - when an error occurs, instead of "status". Use this for objects
  of type Status and DBException
- **reason** - to provide rationale for an event/action when "error" isn't
  appropriate

### Examples

- Example 1:

      LOGV2(1041, "Transition to PRIMARY complete");

  JSON Output:

      { ... , "id": 1041, "msg": "Transition to PRIMARY complete", "attr": {} }

- Example 2:

      LOGV2(1042, "Slow query", "duration"_attr = getDurationMillis());

  JSON Output:

      { ..., "id": 1042, "msg": "Slow query", "attr": { "durationMillis": 1000 } }

  [RollbackImpl::\_summarizeRollback][_summarizeRollback]

- For sharing a string between a log line and a status see [this section of
  InitialSyncer::\_lastOplogEntryFetcherCallbackForStopTimestamp][ _lastOplogEntryFetcherCallbackForStopTimestamp]

# Basic Usage

The log system is made available with the following header:

    #include "mongo/logv2/log.h"

The macro `MONGO_LOGV2_DEFAULT_COMPONENT` is expanded by all logging macros.
This configuration macro must expand at their point of use to a `LogComponent`
expression, which is implicitly attached to the emitted message. It is
conventionally defined near the top of a `.cpp` file after headers are included,
and before any logging macros are invoked. Example:

    #define MONGO_LOGV2_DEFAULT_COMPONENT ::mongo::logv2::LogComponent::kDefault

Logging is performed using function style macros:

    LOGV2(ID,
          message-string,
          "name0"_attr = var0,
          ...,
          "nameN"_attr = varN);

The ID is a signed 32bit integer in the same number space as the error code
numbers. It is used to uniquely identify a log statement. If changing existing
code, using a new ID is strongly advised to avoid any parsing ambiguity. When
selecting ID during work on JIRA ticket `SERVER-ABCDE` you can use the JIRA
ticket number to avoid ID collisions with other engineers by taking ID from the
range `ABCDE00` - `ABCDE99`.

Attributes are created with the `_attr` user-defined literal. The intermediate
object that gets instantiated provides the assignment operator `=` for
assigning a value to the attribute.

The message string must be a compile time constant.
This is to avoid dynamic attribute names in the log output and to be able to
add compile time verification of log statements in the future. If the string
needs to be shared with anything else (like constructing a Status object) you
can use this pattern:

    static constexpr char str[] = "the string";

##### Examples

- No attributes.

      LOGV2(1000, "Logging event, no replacement fields is OK");

- Some attributes.

      LOGV2(1002,
            "Replication state change",
            "from"_attr = getOldState(),
            "to"_attr = getNewState());

### Log Component

To override the default component, a separate logging API can be used that
takes a `LogOptions` structure:

    LOGV2_OPTIONS(options, message-string, attr0, ...);

`LogOptions` can be constructed with a `LogComponent` to avoid verbosity in the
log statement.

##### Example

    LOGV2_OPTIONS(1003, {LogComponent::kCommand}, "To the command component");

### Log Severity

`LOGV2` is the logging macro for the default informational (0) severity. To log
to different severities there are separate logging macros to be used, they all
take paramaters like `LOGV2`:

- `LOGV2_WARNING`
- `LOGV2_ERROR`
- `LOGV2_FATAL`
- `LOGV2_FATAL_NOTRACE`
- `LOGV2_FATAL_CONTINUE`

There is also variations that take `LogOptions` if needed:

- `LOGV2_WARNING_OPTIONS`
- `LOGV2_ERROR_OPTIONS`
- `LOGV2_FATAL_OPTIONS`

Fatal level log statements using `LOGV2_FATAL` perform `fassert` after logging,
using the provided ID as assert id. `LOGV2_FATAL_NOTRACE` perform
`fassertNoTrace` and `LOGV2_FATAL_CONTINUE` does not `fassert` allowing for
continued execution. `LOGV2_FATAL_CONTINUE` is meant to be used when a fatal
error has occured but a different way of halting execution is desired such as
`std::terminate` or `fassertFailedWithStatus`.

`LOGV2_FATAL_OPTIONS` performs `fassert` by default like `LOGV2_FATAL` but this
can be changed by setting the `FatalMode` on the `LogOptions`.

Debug-level logging is slightly different where an additional parameter (as
integer) required to indicate the desired debug level:

    LOGV2_DEBUG(ID, debug-level, message-string, attr0, ...);

    LOGV2_DEBUG_OPTIONS(
        ID,
        debug-level,
        options,
        message-string,
        attr0, ...);

`LOGV2_PROD_ONLY` logs like a default `LOGV2` log in production, but debug-1 log
in internal testing. It accepts the same arguments as `LOGV2`. This log level is
for log lines that may be spammy in testing but are more rare in production. As
such, they may be useful in investigations. This level also preserves backwards
compatibility for logs that are no longer as useful as when they were introduced.
To determine whether to log, this macro uses the `LogSeverity::ProdOnly()`
level, which returns level `LogSeverity::Debug(1)` when in a testing environment
and `LogSeverity::Log()` otherwise. Whether the server is in a testing
environment is determined using the `enableTestCommands` server parameter.
It is preferred to use other macros over this one as it introduces a difference
between testing and production. There is also the `LOGV2_PROD_ONLY_OPTIONS`
variation that takes `LogOptions`.

##### Example

    Status status = ...;
    int remainingAttempts = ...;
    LOGV2_ERROR(1004,
                "Initial sync failed.",
                "reason"_attr = status,
                "remainingAttempts"_attr = remainingAttempts);

### Log Tags

Log tags are replacing the Tee from the old log system as the way to indicate
that the log should also be written to a `RamLog` (accessible with the `getLog`
command).

Tags are added to a log statement with the options API similarly to how
non-default components are specified by constructing a `LogOptions`.

Multiple tags can be attached to a log statement using the bitwise or operator
`|`.

##### Example

    LOGV2_WARNING_OPTIONS(
        1005,
        {LogTag::kStartupWarnings},
        "XFS filesystem is recommended with WiredTiger");

### Dynamic attributes

Sometimes there is a need to add attributes depending on runtime conditionals.
To support this there is the `DynamicAttributes` class that has an `add` method
to add named attributes one by one. This class is meant to be used when you
have this specific requirement and is not the general logging API.

When finished, it is logged using the regular logging API but the
`DynamicAttributes` instance is passed as the first attribute parameter. Mixing
`_attr` literals with the `DynamicAttributes` is not supported.

When using the `DynamicAttributes` you need to be careful about parameter
lifetimes. The `DynamicAttributes` binds attributes _by reference_ and the
reference must be valid when passing the `DynamicAttributes` to the log
statement.

##### Example

    DynamicAttributes attrs;
    attrs.add("str", "StringData value"_sd);
    if (condition) {
        // getExtraInfo() returns a reference that is valid until the LOGV2
        // call below. Be careful of functions returning by value.
        attrs.add("extra", getExtraInfo());
    }
    LOGV2(1030, "Dynamic attributes", attrs);

# Type Support

### Built-in

Many basic types have built in support:

- Boolean
- Integral types
  - Single `char` is logged as integer
- Enums
  - Logged as their underlying integral type
- Floating point types
  - `long double` is prohibited
- String types
  - `std::string`
  - `StringData`
  - `const char*`
- Duration types
  - Special formatting, see below
- BSON types
  - `BSONObj`
  - `BSONArray`
  - `BSONElement`
- BSON appendable types
  - `BSONObjBuilder::append` overload available
- `boost::optional<T>` of any loggable type `T`

### User-defined types

To make a user-defined type loggable it needs a serialization member function
that the log system can bind to.

The system binds and uses serialization functions by looking for functions in
the following priority order:

- Structured serialization functions
  - `void x.serialize(BSONObjBuilder*) const` (member)
  - `BSONObj x.toBSON() const` (member)
  - `BSONArray x.toBSONArray() const` (member)
  - `toBSON(x)` (non-member)
- Stringification functions
  - `toStringForLogging(x)` (non-member)
  - `x.serialize(&fmtMemoryBuffer)` (member)
  - `x.toString() ` (member)
  - `toString(x)` (non-member)

Enums cannot have member functions, but they will still try to bind to the
`toStringForLogging(e)` or `toString(e)` non-members. If neither is available,
the enum value will be logged as its underlying integral type.

In order to offer structured serialization and output, a type would need to
supply a structured serialization function. Otherwise, if only stringification
is provided, the output will be an escaped string.

The `toStringForLogging` non-member is an ADL customization hook used to
override `toString` for very rare cases where `toString` is inappropriate for
logging perhaps because it's needed for other non-logging formatting. Usually a
`toString` (member or nonmember) is a sufficient customization point and should
be preferred as a canonical stringification of the object.

_NOTE: No `operator<<` overload is used even if available_

##### Example

    class UserDefinedType {
    public:
        void serialize(BSONObjBuilder* builder) const {
            builder->append("str"_sd, _str);
            builder->append("int"_sd, _int);
        }

    private:
        std::string _str;
        int32_t _int;
    };

### Container support

STL containers and data structures that have STL like interfaces are loggable
as long as they contain loggable elements (built-in, user-defined or other
containers).

#### Sequential containers

Sequential containers like `std::vector`, `std::deque` and `std::list` are
loggable and the elements get formatted as JSON array in structured output.

#### Associative containers

Associative containers such as `std::map` and `stdx::unordered_map` loggable
with the requirement that they key is of a string type. The structured format
is a JSON object where the field names are the key.

#### Ranges

Ranges is loggable via helpers to indicate what type of range it is

- `seqLog(begin, end)`
- `mapLog(begin, end)`

seqLog indicates that it is a sequential range where the iterators point to
loggable value directly.

mapLog indicates that it is a range coming from an associative container where
the iterators point to a key-value pair.

##### Examples

- Logging a sequence:

      std::array<int, 20> arrayOfInts = ...;
      LOGV2(1010,
            "Log container directly",
            "values"_attr = arrayOfInts);
      LOGV2(1011,
            "Log iterator range",
            "values"_attr = seqLog(arrayOfInts.begin(), arrayOfInts.end());
      LOGV2(1012,
            "Log first five elements",
            "values"_attr = seqLog(arrayOfInts.data(), arrayOfInts.data() + 5);

- Logging a map-like container:

      StringMap<BSONObj> bsonMap = ...;
      LOGV2(1013,
            "Log map directly",
            "values"_attr = bsonMap);
      LOGV2(1014,
            "Log map iterator range",
            "values"_attr = mapLog(bsonMap.begin(), bsonMap.end());

#### Containers and `uint64_t`

Logging of containers uses `BSONObj` as an internal representation and
`uint64_t` is not a supported type with `BSONObjBuilder::append()`. As a user
you can use `boost::transform_iterator` to cast the `uint64_t` to a supported
type.

##### Example

    std::vector<uint64_t> vec = ...;

    // If we know casting to signed is safe
    auto asSigned = [](uint64_t i) { return static_cast<int64_t>(i); };
    LOGV2(2000,
          "As signed array",
          "values"_attr = seqLog(
              boost::make_transform_iterator(vec.begin(), asSigned),
              boost::make_transform_iterator(vec.end(), asSigned)));

    // Otherwise we can log as any of these types instead of using asSigned
    auto asDecimal128 = [](uint64_t i) { return Decimal128(i); };
    auto asString = [](uint64_t i) { return std::to_string(i); };

### Duration types

Duration types have special formatting to match existing practices in the
server code base. Their resulting format depends on the context they are
logged.

When durations are formatted as JSON or BSON a unit suffix is added to the
attribute name when building the field name. The value will be count of the
duration as a number.

When logging containers with durations there is no attribute per duration
instance that can have the suffix added. In this case durations are instead
formatted as a BSON object.

##### Examples

- "duration" attribute

  C++ expression:

        "duration"_attr = Milliseconds(10)

  JSON format:

        "durationMillis": 10

- Container of Duration objects

  C++ expression:

        "samples"_attr = std::vector<Nanoseconds>{Nanoseconds(200),
                                                  Nanoseconds(400)}

  JSON format:

        "samples": [{"durationNanos": 200}, {"durationNanos": 400}]

# Attribute naming abstraction

The style guide contains recommendations for attribute naming in certain cases.
To make abstraction of attribute naming possible a `logAttrs` function can be
implemented as a friend function in a class with the following signature:

    class AnyUserType {
    public:
        friend auto logAttrs(const AnyUserType& instance) {
            return "name"_attr=instance;
        }

        BSONObj toBSON() const; // Type needs to be loggable
    };

##### Examples

    const AnyUserType& t = ...;
    LOGV2(2001, "Log of user type", logAttr(t));

## Multiple attributes

In some cases a loggable type might be composed as a hierarchy in the C++ type
system which would lead to a very verbose structured log output as every level
in the hierarcy needs a name when outputted as JSON. The attribute naming
abstraction system can also be used to collapse such hierarchies. Instead of
making a type loggable it can instead return one or more attributes from its
members by using `multipleAttrs` in `logAttrs` functions.

`multipleAttrs(...)` accepts attributes or instances of types with `logAttrs`
functions implemented.

##### Examples

    class NotALoggableType {
        std::string name;
        BSONObj data;

        friend auto logAttrs(const NotALoggableType& instance) {
            return logv2::multipleAttrs("name"_attr=instance.name,
                                        "data"_attr=instance.data);
        }
    };

    NotALoggableType t = ...;

    // These two log statements are equivalent:
    LOGV2(2002, "Statement", logAttrs(t));
    LOGV2(2002, "Statement", "name"_attr=t.name, "data"_attr=t.data);

## Handling temporary lifetime with multiple attributes

To avoid lifetime issues (log attributes bind their values by reference) it is
recommended to **not** create attributes when using `multipleAttrs` unless
attributes are created for members directly. If `logAttrs` or `""_attr=` is
used inside a `logAttrs` function on the return of a function returning by
value it will result in a dangling reference. The following example illustrates
the problem:

    class SomeSubType {
    public:
        BSONObj toBSON() const {...};

        friend auto logAttrs(const SomeSubType& sub) {
            return "subAttr"_attr=sub;
        }
    };

    class SomeType {
    public:
        const std::string& name() const { return name_; }
        SomeSubType sub() const { return sub_; } // Returning by value!

        friend auto logAttrs(const SomeType& type) {
            // logAttrs(type.sub()) below will contain a dangling reference!
            return logv2::multipleAttrs("name"_attr=type.name(),
                                        logAttrs(type.sub()));
        }
    private:
        SomeSubType sub_;
        std::string name_;
    };

The better implementation would be to let the log system control the
lifetime by passing the instance to `multipleAttrs` without creating the
attribute. The log system will detect that it is not an attribute and will
attempt to create attributes by calling `logAttrs`:

    friend auto logAttrs(const SomeType& type) {
        return logv2::multipleAttrs("name"_attr=type.name(), type.sub());
    }

# Additional features

## Combining uassert with log statement

Code that emits a high severity log statement may also need to emit a `uassert`
after the log. There is the `UserAssertAfterLog` logging option that allows you
to re-use the log statement to do the formatting required for the `uassert`.
The assertion id can be either the logging ID by passing `UserAssertAfterLog`
with no arguments or the assertion id can set by constructing
`UserAssertAfterLog` with an `ErrorCodes::Error`.

The assertion reason string will be a plain text log and can be provided with additional attribute
arguments.

##### Examples

    LOGV2_ERROR_OPTIONS(1050000,
                        {UserAssertAfterLog()},
                        "Assertion after log");

Would emit a `uassert` after performing the log that is equivalent to:

    uasserted(1050000, "Assertion after log");

Using a named error code:

    LOGV2_ERROR_OPTIONS(
        1050,
        {UserAssertAfterLog(ErrorCodes::DataCorruptionDetected)},
        "Data corruption detected",
        "recordId"_attr=RecordId(123456));

Would emit a `uassert` after performing the log that is equivalent to:

    uasserted(ErrorCodes::DataCorruptionDetected,
              "Data corruption detected for RecordId(123456)");

## Unstructured logging for local development

To make it easier to use the log system for tracing in local development, there
is a special API that does not use IDs or attribute names:

    logd(format-string, value0, ..., valueN);

It formats the string using libfmt similarly to what
`fmt::format(format-string, value0, ..., valueN)` would produce but using the
regular log system type support on how types are made loggable. The formatted
string is logged as the `msg` field in the JSON output, with no `attr`
subobject.

When using `logd` the log will emitted with standard severity and the default
component.

A difference from regular logging, `logd` is allowed to be used in header files
by including `logv2/log_debug.h`.

Unstructured logging is not allowed to be used in code committed to master,
there is a lint check to validate this. It is however allowed to be used in
Evergreen patch builds.

##### Examples

    UserDefinedType t; // Defined in previous example
    logd("this is a debug log, value 1: {} and value 2: {}", 1, t);

# JSON output format

Produces structured logs of the [Relaxed Extended JSON 2.0.0][relaxed_json_2]
format. Below is an example of a log statement in C++ and a pretty-printed JSON
output:

C++ statement:

    BSONObjBuilder builder;
    builder.append("first"_sd, 1);
    builder.append("second"_sd, "str");

    std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3};

    LOGV2_ERROR(1020,
                "Example",
                "bson"_attr = builder.obj(),
                "vector"_attr = vec,
                "optional"_attr = boost::none);

Output:

    {
        "t": {
            "$date": "2020-01-06T19:10:54.246Z"
        },
        "s": "E",
        "c": "NETWORK",
        "ctx": "conn1",
        "id": 23453,
        "msg": "Example",
        "attr": {
            "bson": {
                "first": 1,
                "second": "str"
            },
            "vector": [1, 2, 3],
            "optional": null
        }
    }
