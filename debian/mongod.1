.SH MONGOD
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmongod\f1\f1 is the primary daemon process for the MongoDB
system. It handles data requests, manages data access, and performs
background management operations.
.PP
This document provides a complete overview of all command line options
for \fBmongod\f1\f1\&. These command line options are primarily useful
for testing: In common operation, use the \fBconfiguration file
options\f1 to control the behavior of
your database.

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB disables support for TLS 1.0
encryption on systems where TLS 1.1+ is available. For
more details, see \fBDisable TLS 1.0\f1\&.

The hostnames and/or IP addresses and/or full Unix domain socket
paths on which \fBmongod\f1\f1 should listen for client connections. You

You can specify both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, or hostnames that
resolve to an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
.PP
If specifying an IPv6 address \fIor\f1 a hostname that resolves to an
IPv6 address to \fB\-\-bind_ip\f1\f1, you must start \fBmongod\f1\f1 with
\fB\-\-ipv6\f1\f1 to enable IPv6 support. Specifying an IPv6 address

.PP
If specifying a
link\-local IPv6 address (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link\-local_address#IPv6)
(\fBfe80::/10\f1), you must append the
zone index (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address#Scoped_literal_IPv6_addresses_(with_zone_index))
to that address (i.e. \fBfe80::<address>%<adapter\-name>\f1).
.PP
To avoid configuration updates due to IP address changes, use DNS
hostnames instead of IP addresses. It is particularly important to
use a DNS hostname instead of an IP address when configuring replica
set members or sharded cluster members.
.PP
Use hostnames instead of IP addresses to configure clusters across a
split network horizon. Starting in MongoDB 5.0, nodes that are only
configured with an IP address will fail startup validation and will
not start.
.PP
Before binding to a non\-localhost (e.g. publicly accessible)
IP address, ensure you have secured your cluster from unauthorized
access. For a complete list of security recommendations, see
\fBSecurity Checklist\f1\&. At minimum, consider
\fBenabling authentication\f1 and

.PP
\fBmongod\f1\f1 only supports IPv6 if started with \fB\-\-ipv6\f1\f1\&. Specifying
\fB\-\-bind_ip_all\f1\f1 alone does not enable IPv6 support.

The maximum number of connections that can exist in the listen

Consult your local system\(aqs documentation to understand the
limitations and configuration requirements before using this

To prevent undefined behavior, specify a value for this

constant.
.PP
The default value for the \fBlistenBacklog\f1 parameter is set at
compile time to the target system \fBSOMAXCONN\f1 constant.
\fBSOMAXCONN\f1 is the maximum valid value that is documented for
the \fIbacklog\f1 parameter to the \fIlisten\f1 system call.
.PP
Some systems may interpret \fBSOMAXCONN\f1 symbolically, and others
numerically. The actual \fIlisten backlog\f1 applied in practice may
differ from any numeric interpretation of the \fBSOMAXCONN\f1 constant
or argument to \fB\-\-listenBacklog\f1, and may also be constrained by
system settings like \fBnet.core.somaxconn\f1 on Linux.
.PP
Passing a value for the \fBlistenBacklog\f1 parameter that exceeds the
\fBSOMAXCONN\f1 constant for the local system is, by the letter of the
standards, undefined behavior. Higher values may be silently integer
truncated, may be ignored, may cause unexpected resource
consumption, or have other adverse consequences.
.PP
On systems with workloads that exhibit connection spikes, for which
it is empirically known that the local system can honor higher
values for the \fIbacklog\f1 parameter than the \fBSOMAXCONN\f1 constant,
setting the \fBlistenBacklog\f1 parameter to a higher value may reduce
operation latency as observed by the client by reducing the number
of connections which are forced into a backoff state.

A \fBmongod\f1\f1 running with \fB\-\-redactClientLogData\f1\f1 redacts any message accompanying a given
log event before logging. This prevents the \fBmongod\f1\f1 from writing
potentially sensitive data stored on the database to the diagnostic log.

For example, a MongoDB deployment might store Personally Identifiable

such as those related to CRUD operations, sharding metadata, etc. It is
possible that the \fBmongod\f1\f1 may expose PII as a part of these logging
operations. A \fBmongod\f1\f1 running with \fB\-\-redactClientLogData\f1\f1 removes any message
accompanying these events before being output to the log, effectively
removing the PII.

Diagnostics on a \fBmongod\f1\f1 running with \fB\-\-redactClientLogData\f1\f1 may be more difficult

For example, on a system with a total of 4GB of RAM the WiredTiger

Conversely, a system with a total of 1.25 GB of RAM will allocate 256

In some instances, such as when running in a container, the database

To see the memory limit, see \fBhostInfo.system.memLimitMB\f1\f1\&.

With WiredTiger, MongoDB utilizes both the WiredTiger internal cache

Via the filesystem cache, MongoDB automatically uses all free memory

.PP
The \fB\-\-wiredTigerCacheSizeGB\f1\f1 limits the size of the WiredTiger internal

for filesystem cache, which allows the compressed MongoDB data
files to stay in memory. In addition, the operating system will
use any free RAM to buffer file system blocks and file system
cache.
.PP
To accommodate the additional consumers of RAM, you may have to
decrease WiredTiger internal cache size.

The default WiredTiger internal cache size value assumes that there is a
