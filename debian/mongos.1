.SH MONGOS INSTANCES
.SH SYNOPSIS
For a \fBsharded cluster\f1, the \fBmongos\f1
instances provide the interface between the client applications and the
sharded cluster. The \fBmongos\f1 instances route queries and
write operations to the shards. From the perspective of the
application, a \fBmongos\f1 instance behaves identically to
any other MongoDB instance.
.SH CONSIDERATIONS
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Never change the name of the \fBmongos\f1 binary.
.IP \(bu 2
MongoDB disables support for TLS 1.0
encryption on systems where TLS 1.1+ is available.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBmongos\f1\f1 binary cannot connect to \fBmongod\f1\f1
instances whose \fBfeature compatibility version (FCV)\f1 is greater
than that of the \fBmongos\f1\f1\&. For example, you cannot connect
a MongoDB 5.0 version \fBmongos\f1\f1 to a 8.0
sharded cluster with \fBFCV\f1 set to 8.0\&. You
can, however, connect a MongoDB 5.0 version
\fBmongos\f1\f1 to a 8.0 sharded cluster with \fBFCV\f1 set to 5.0\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmongod\f1\f1 includes a \fBFull Time Diagnostic Data Capture\f1 mechanism to assist MongoDB engineers with troubleshooting
deployments. If this thread fails, it terminates the originating process.
To avoid the most common failures, confirm that the user running the
process has permissions to create the FTDC \fBdiagnostic.data\f1
directory. For \fBmongod\f1 the directory is within
\fBstorage.dbPath\f1\f1\&. For \fBmongos\f1 it is parallel to \fBsystemLog.path\f1\f1\&.

.PP
The hostnames and/or IP addresses and/or full Unix domain socket
paths on which \fBmongos\f1 should listen for client connections. You
may attach \fBmongos\f1 to any interface. To bind to multiple
addresses, enter a list of comma\-separated values.
.PP
You can specify both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, or hostnames that
resolve to an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
.PP
If specifying an IPv6 address \fIor\f1 a hostname that resolves to an
IPv6 address to \fB\-\-bind_ip\f1\f1, you must start \fBmongos\f1 with
\fB\-\-ipv6\f1\f1 to enable IPv6 support. Specifying an IPv6 address
to \fB\-\-bind_ip\f1\f1 does not enable IPv6 support.
.PP
If specifying a
link\-local IPv6 address (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link\-local_address#IPv6)
(\fBfe80::/10\f1), you must append the
zone index (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address#Scoped_literal_IPv6_addresses_(with_zone_index))
to that address (i.e. \fBfe80::<address>%<adapter\-name>\f1).
.PP
To avoid configuration updates due to IP address changes, use DNS
hostnames instead of IP addresses. It is particularly important to
use a DNS hostname instead of an IP address when configuring replica
set members or sharded cluster members.
.PP
Use hostnames instead of IP addresses to configure clusters across a
split network horizon. Starting in MongoDB 5.0, nodes that are only
configured with an IP address fail startup validation and do not start.
.PP
Before you bind your instance to a publicly\-accessible IP address,
you must secure your cluster from unauthorized access. For a complete
list of security recommendations, see
\fBSecurity Checklist for Self\-Managed Deployments\f1\&. At minimum, consider
\fBenabling authentication\f1 and \fBhardening
network infrastructure\f1\&.

\fBmongos \-\-bind_ip_all\f1

If specified, the \fBmongos\f1 instance binds to all IPv4

\fB\-\-ipv6\f1\f1, \fB\-\-bind_ip_all\f1\f1 also binds to all IPv6 addresses
(i.e. \fB::\f1).
.PP
\fBmongos\f1 only supports IPv6 if started with \fB\-\-ipv6\f1\f1\&. Specifying
\fB\-\-bind_ip_all\f1\f1 alone does not enable IPv6 support.
.PP
Before you bind your instance to a publicly\-accessible IP address,
you must secure your cluster from unauthorized access. For a complete

\fBmongos \-\-listenBacklog\f1
.RS
.PP
\fIDefault\f1: Target system \fBSOMAXCONN\f1 constant
.PP
The maximum number of connections that can exist in the listen
queue.
.PP
Consult your local system\(aqs documentation to understand the
limitations and configuration requirements before using this
parameter.
.PP
To prevent undefined behavior, specify a value for this
parameter between \fB1\f1 and the local system \fBSOMAXCONN\f1
constant.
.PP
The default value for the \fBlistenBacklog\f1 parameter depends on the
target system. On Linux, MongoDB uses \fB/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn\f1\&.
On all other target systems, MongoDB uses the compile time constant
\fBSOMAXCONN\f1\&.
.PP
Some systems may interpret \fBSOMAXCONN\f1 symbolically, and others
numerically. The actual \fIlisten backlog\f1 applied in practice may
differ from any numeric interpretation of the \fBSOMAXCONN\f1 constant
or argument to \fB\-\-listenBacklog\f1\&.
.PP
Passing a value for the \fBlistenBacklog\f1 parameter that exceeds the
\fBSOMAXCONN\f1 constant for the local system is, by the letter of the
standards, undefined behavior. Higher values may be silently integer
truncated, may be ignored, may cause unexpected resource
consumption, or have other adverse consequences.
.RE
.PP
\fBmongos \-\-maxConns\f1
.RS
.PP
The maximum number of simultaneous connections that \fBmongos\f1
accepts. This setting has no effect if it is higher than your
operating system\(aqs configured maximum connection tracking threshold.
.PP
Do not assign too low of a value to this option, or you will
encounter errors during normal application operation.
.PP
This is particularly useful for a \fBmongos\f1\f1 if you have a client
that creates multiple connections and allows them to timeout rather
than closing them.
.PP
In this case, set \fBmaxIncomingConnections\f1\f1 to a value slightly
higher than the maximum number of connections that the client creates, or the
maximum size of the connection pool.
.PP
This setting prevents the \fBmongos\f1 from causing connection spikes on
the individual \fBshards\f1\&. Spikes like these may disrupt the
operation and memory allocation of the \fBsharded cluster\f1\&.

.PP
The \fB\-\-syslog\f1\f1 option is not supported on Windows.

\fIAvailable in MongoDB Enterprise only.\f1
.PP
A \fBmongos\f1 running with \fB\-\-redactClientLogData\f1\f1 redacts any message accompanying a given
log event before logging. This prevents the \fBmongos\f1 from writing
potentially sensitive data stored on the database to the diagnostic log.
Metadata such as error or operation codes, line numbers, and source file
names are still visible in the logs.
.PP
Use \fB\-\-redactClientLogData\f1\f1 in conjunction with
\fBEncryption at Rest\f1 and
\fBTLS/SSL (Transport Encryption)\f1 to assist compliance with
regulatory requirements.
.PP
For example, a MongoDB deployment might store Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) in one or more collections. The \fBmongos\f1 logs events
such as those related to CRUD operations, sharding metadata, etc. It is
possible that the \fBmongos\f1 may expose PII as a part of these logging
operations. A \fBmongos\f1 running with \fB\-\-redactClientLogData\f1\f1 removes any message
accompanying these events before being output to the log, effectively
removing the PII.
.PP
Diagnostics on a \fBmongos\f1 running with \fB\-\-redactClientLogData\f1\f1 may be more difficult
due to the lack of data related to a log event. See the
\fBprocess logging\f1 manual page for an
example of the effect of \fB\-\-redactClientLogData\f1\f1 on log output.
