testtools: tasteful testing for Python
======================================

testtools is a set of extensions to the Python standard library's unit testing
framework. These extensions have been derived from many years of experience
with unit testing in Python and come from many different sources. testtools
also ports recent unittest changes all the way back to Python 2.4.
