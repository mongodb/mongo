# This file is used to tag JS tests for retry on failure that run in the mainline.
#
# For JS tests that have failed, you can tag them to be retried. The following scenarios apply:
#
# 1. the test sometimes fails in any task on any build variant with any distro,
# 2. the test sometimes fails in a specific task on any build variant with any distro,
# 3. the test sometimes fails in a specific task on a specific build variant with any distro, or
# 4. the test sometimes fails in a specific task on a specific build variant with a specific distro.
#
# Depending on which of the above scenarios apply, you can tag the JS file with the following tags,
# respectively.
#
# 1. retry_on_failure
# 2. retry_on_failure|${task_name}
# 3. retry_on_failure|${task_name}|${build_variant}
# 4. retry_on_failure|${task_name}|${build_variant}|${distro_id}
#
# Examples:
#
#   JS test failed: jstests/sharding/exact_shard_key_target.js
#     in task_name: sharding_csrs_continuous_config_stepdown_WT
# on build_variant: any
#   with distro_id: any
#         tag with: retry_on_failure|sharding_csrs_continuous_config_stepdown_WT
#
#   JS test failed: jstests/noPassthrough/backup_restore_stop_start.js
#     in task_name: noPassthrough
# on build_variant: enterprise-rhel-62-64-bit
#   with distro_id: rhel62-small
#         tag with: retry_on_failure|noPassthrough|enterprise-rhel-62-64-bit|rhel62-small
#
# Example of tagging a test affecting multiple tasks:
#
#   JS test failed: jstests/sharding/shard_collection_verify_initial_chunks.js
#     in task_name: sharding and sharding_WT
# on build_variant: linux-64
#   with distro_id: any
#         tag with: retry_on_failure|sharding|linux-64 and
#                   retry_on_failure|sharding_WT|linux-64
#
#
# Note: Making it possible to ignore test failures increases the risk we won't (or will take
# longer to) discover a bug and therefore tests should be tagged judiciously.
