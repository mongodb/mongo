#            This file contains thresholds for performance tests run by resmoke. These correspond to   #
#            the GenerateAndCheckPerfResults hook. Thresholds are set on a per variant basis.          #
#            Make sure to set the --variantName flag when running benchmarks in resmoke.               #

#            Each entry should follow the format below                                                 #

#             bound_direction: {What the threshold direction should be. Must be one of upper or lower}
#
#
#
#
#     Bound direction upper means that the value reported by the test must be BELOW the threshold value.
#     Bound direction lower means that the value reported by the test must be ABOVE the threshold value.
