# This file is intended to track tests that should be denylisted from multiversion testing due to
# changes that have not yet been backported to the last-lts or last-continuous development
# branches.
#
# Usage:
# Add the server ticket number and the path to the test file for the test you intend to denylist
# under the appropriate suite. Any test in a (ticket, test_file) pair that appears in this file but
# not in the last-lts or last-continuous branch version of this file indicates that a commit has
# not yet been backported to the last-lts or last-continuous branch and will be excluded from the
# multiversion suite corresponding to the root level suite key.
#
# Example: To prevent 'my_test_file.js' from running in the 'replica_sets_multiversion' suite with the last-continuous binary
# replica_sets_multiversion:
#   - ticket: SERVER-1000
#     test_file: jstests/core/my_test_file.js
#
# The above example will denylist jstests/core/my_test_file.js from the
# 'replica_sets_multiversion_gen' task until this file has been updated with the same
# (ticket, test_file) pair on the last-lts branch.
