# This file is intended to track tests that should be blacklisted from multiversion testing due to
# changes that have not yet been backported to the last-lts development branch.
#
# Usage:
# Add the server ticket number and the path to the test file for the test you intend to blacklist
# under the appropriate suite. Any test in a (ticket, test_file) pair that appears in this file but
# not in the last-lts branch version of this file indicates that a commit has not yet been
# backported to the last-lts branch and will be excluded from the multiversion suite
# corresponding to the root level suite key.
#
# Example:
# replica_sets_multiversion:
#   - ticket: SERVER-1000
#     test_file: jstests/core/my_test_file.js
#
# The above example will blacklist jstests/core/my_test_file.js from the
# 'replica_sets_multiversion_gen' task until this file has been updated with the same
# (ticket, test_file) pair on the last-lts branch.
#

# Tests that should be excluded from ALL multiversion suites should be listed here.
