# What Is This Folder

This folder is for custom pull request templates. Templates are Markdown (\*.md) files.

These custom templates can be used for example, by individual teams to have a custom pull request template with team specific testing or documentation instructions.

If you update the default PR template, you also need to update the commit metadata in github branch rulesets.

# How To Use This Folder

To create a custom template, create a new markdown file in this folder.

Then create a link of the form `https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/compare/main...my-branch?quick_pull=1&template=your_new_template.md`

Share that link in your team docs to use for creating PRs. By selecting an unused values for `my-branch` it should show a branch selector when following the link.
